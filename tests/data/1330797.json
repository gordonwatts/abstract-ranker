Through this unique forum, we will explore the areas where these disciplines overlap with computer science, fostering the exchange of ideas related to cutting-edge computing, data-analysis, and theoretical-calculation technologies.<\/p>\r\n<p>Our Theme will be<strong> Foundation Models for Physics - Nexus of Computation and Physics through Embracing the Era of Foundation Models:<\/strong> The 2024 ACAT workshop invites the vanguard of computational and physics experts to delve into the transformative potential of foundation models. As the intersection between physics and computational realms deepens, these advanced models, underpinned by colossal datasets and capable of generating nuanced outputs, are redefining the research spectrum and increasingly reshaping the way researchers approach complex problems, simulations, and data analyses. As we chart this new territory, we'll address challenges and opportunities encompassing integration into computational ecosystems, innovative data practices, training nuances, infrastructure evolution, uncertainty metrics, ethical dimensions, and collaborative vistas across disciplines.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;\">\u00a0<\/p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"color: #e74c3c;\">News on abstract selections<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<p>Information will be provided soon.<\/p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"color: #e74c3c;\">More Info<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: null;\">You can sign up for email notifications acat-info@cern.ch by sending email to\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"mailto:acat-loc2022@cern.ch\"><span style=\"color: null;\">acat-loc2024@cern.ch!<\/span><\/a><span style=\"color: null;\">\u00a0This list is low traffic and will only get you ACAT conference announcements and general information (for this and future conferences in the ACAT series).<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: null;\">Many people are working together to bring you this conference!

Wang Center, Stony Brook University ","type":"Oral","description":"Computer algebra plays an important role in particle physics calculations. In particular, the calculation and manipulation of large multi-variable polynomials and rational functions are key bottlenecks when calculating multi-loop scattering amplitudes. Recent years have seen the widespread adoption of interpolation techniques to target these bottlenecks. This talk will present new techniques using p-adic numbers to interpolate such rational functions in a compact form. The techniques are demonstrated on large rational functions at the edge of current capabilities, taken from 2-loop 5-point amplitude calculations. The number of required numerical (p-adic) samples is found to be around 25 times smaller than in conventional (finite-field-based) techniques, and the obtained result is 130 times more compact.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2819338,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4922839,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5861154\/attachments\/2819338\/4922839\/Chawdhry_padic_reconstruction_ACAT_conference_2024_03_13.pdf","title":"Chawdhry_padic_reconstruction_ACAT_conference_2024_03_13.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-13T16:21:32.173191+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"Chawdhry_padic_reconstruction_ACAT_conference_2024_03_13.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":972699,"checksum":"54d77d8524fb0c2cf7a5d8458834c696"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5861154\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Herschel","last_name":"Chawdhry","fullName":"Chawdhry, Herschel","id":"8537548","affiliation":"Florida State University","emailHash":"84c21c8fe33706349df62579851c0b24","db_id":8537548,"person_id":8316704}],"primaryauthors":[],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":null,"session":"Track 3: Computations in Theoretical Physics: Techniques and Methods","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"167","db_id":5778899,"friendly_id":167,"title":"Computing the wave: Where the Gravitational Wave Community benefits from HEP, and where it differs?","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-13","time":"17:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-13","time":"18:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":30,"roomFullname":"Theatre","room":"Theatre","note":{"html":"","url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5778899\/note\/","modified_dt":"2024-04-08T10:07:12.372988+00:00","user":68439},"location":" Charles B.

This Monte Carlo (MC) simulation based on Geant4 was a major consumer of computing resources during the 2018 data-taking year and is anticipated to remain one of the dominant resource users in the HL-LHC era. ATLAS has continuously been working to improve the computational performance of this simulation for the Run 3 Monte Carlo campaign. This report highlights the recent implementation of Woodcock tracking in the Electromagnetic Endcap Calorimeter and provides an overview of other implemented and upcoming optimizations. These improvements include enhancements to the core Geant4 software, strategic choices in simulation configuration, simplifications in geometry and magnetic field descriptions, and technical refinements in the interface between ATLAS simulation code and Geant4. Overall, these improvements have resulted in a more than 100% increase in throughput compared to the baseline simulation configuration utilized during Run 2.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2819414,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4923019,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5801194\/attachments\/2819414\/4923019\/ACAT_2024_Talk-1.pdf","title":"ACAT_2024_Talk-1.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-13T18:30:11.892609+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"ACAT_2024_Talk-1.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":2265600,"checksum":"4183c828529532b7666f3ff5f3850659"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5801194\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Mustafa

The more particles there are in a given process, the more challenging it is for the model to provide accurate predictions for the matrix elements. We present a deep learning framework that is built to reduce the impact of this issue, based on the implementation of permutation invariance and Lorentz equivariance within the network architecture. We demonstrate how the use of both of these symmetries grants the model the necessary structure to reproduce LO and NLO amplitude distributions in a competent way for processes with multiple QCD jets in the final state. Additionally, we use Bayesian networks as a main ingredient for all studied amplitude surrogates. That way, we can perform a Bayesian analysis to understand and optimize the uncertainty on model predictions.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2817789,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4920498,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5792185\/attachments\/2817789\/4920498\/ACAT_victor_breso.pdf","title":"ACAT_victor_breso.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-12T13:52:02.138964+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"ACAT_victor_breso.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":1135865,"checksum":"06dd67679df47bedfe3c7dc38c28274c"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5792185\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"V\u00edctor","last_name":"Bres\u00f3 Pla","fullName":"Bres\u00f3 Pla, V\u00edctor","id":"8418768","affiliation":"University of Heidelberg","emailHash":"4dd049a9f7af8f3da82123b7869f0706","db_id":8418768,"person_id":8143762}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Tilman","last_name":"Plehn","fullName":"Plehn, Tilman","id":"8418767","affiliation":"","emailHash":"9d0398b8070df8b865086ffb837d0a8f","db_id":8418767,"person_id":8143761},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"V\u00edctor","last_name":"Bres\u00f3 Pla","fullName":"Bres\u00f3 Pla, V\u00edctor","id":"8418768","affiliation":"University of Heidelberg","emailHash":"4dd049a9f7af8f3da82123b7869f0706","db_id":8418768,"person_id":8143762}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 3: Computations in Theoretical Physics: Techniques and Methods","session":"Track 3: Computations in Theoretical Physics: Techniques and Methods","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"34","db_id":5796565,"friendly_id":34,"title":"FASER Tracking and Emulsion Station Alignment","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-14","time":"21:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-14","time":"22:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Theatre","room":"Theatre","note":{},"location":" Charles B.

FASER has been taking collision data since the start of LHC Run3 in July 2022. The first physics results were presented in March 2023 [1,2], including the first direct observation of collider neutrinos. FASER includes four identical tracker stations constructed from silicon microstrip detectors, which play a key role in the physics analysis. Specifically the tracker stations are designed to precisely reconstruct the  charged particles arising from a new particle decay, as well as high-energy muons from neutrino interactions. For the current analyses the three upstream tracking stations, the tracking spectrometer, have been used. To take full advantage of the detector in neutrino analyses we need to include the neutrino detector, an emulsion detector, and the InterFace Tracker (IFT). The unique geometry of FASER requires a 2-prong alignment procedure for the tracking stations. The tracking spectrometer, which is supported by a precision aluminium beam, is aligned first then the more challenging alignment of the IFT is performed to correct for its relatively large misalignments.

The comparison of simulation predictions to data allows us to look for rare deviations that can be due to new phenomena not previously observed. We show that novel machine learning algorithms, specifically Normalizing Flows and Flow Matching, can be effectively used to perform accurate simulations with several orders of magnitude of speed-up compared to traditional approaches. The classical simulation chain starts from a physics process of interest, computes energy deposits of particles and electronics response; and finally employs the same reconstruction algorithms used for data. Eventually, the data is reduced to some high-level analysis format. Instead, we propose an end-to-end approach, simulating the final data format directly from physical generator inputs, skipping any intermediate steps. We use particle jets simulation as a benchmark for comparing both *discrete* and *continuous* Normalizing Flows models. The models are validated across a variety of metrics to select the best ones. We discuss the scaling of performance with the increase in training data, as well as the generalization power of these models on physical processes different from the training one. We investigate sampling multiple times from the same inputs, a procedure we name *oversampling*, and we show that it can effectively reduce the statistical uncertainties of a sample. This class of ML algorithms is found to be highly expressive and useful for the task of HEP simulation. Their speed and accuracy, coupled with the stability of the training procedure, make them a compelling tool for the needs of current and future experiments.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2816338,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4922360,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796504\/attachments\/2816338\/4922360\/Vaselli_ACAT2024_v2.pdf","title":"Vaselli_ACAT2024_v2.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-13T13:34:19.903287+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"Vaselli_ACAT2024_v2.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":9890930,"checksum":"f702d4f41c6b4de8806b6f2a5cd9d62b"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796504\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Francesco","last_name":"Vaselli","fullName":"Vaselli, Francesco","id":"8425734","affiliation":"Scuola Normale Superiore & INFN Pisa (IT)","emailHash":"f9711fb2602b81ba0d031767ea5bb30b","db_id":8425734,"person_id":8096297}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Francesco","last_name":"Vaselli","fullName":"Vaselli, Francesco","id":"8425734","affiliation":"Scuola Normale Superiore & INFN Pisa (IT)","emailHash":"f9711fb2602b81ba0d031767ea5bb30b","db_id":8425734,"person_id":8096297}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Andrea","last_name":"Rizzi","fullName":"Rizzi, Andrea","id":"8425735","affiliation":"Universita & INFN Pisa (IT)","emailHash":"691e33f77942fb889afcb7c642a32e7b","db_id":8425735,"person_id":8096299},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Filippo","last_name":"Cattafesta","fullName":"Cattafesta, Filippo","id":"8425737","affiliation":"Universita & INFN Pisa (IT)","emailHash":"37d5edb1808f918c38b3313a659a66be","db_id":8425737,"person_id":8096296},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"Asenov","fullName":"Asenov, Patrick","id":"8425736","affiliation":"Universita & INFN Pisa (IT)","emailHash":"bb48071981ee6ffc1b4c4860c3cc55f0","db_id":8425736,"person_id":8096298}],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","session":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"7","db_id":5796490,"friendly_id":7,"title":"Real-time error mitigation for variational optimization on quantum hardware","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"20:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"20:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Lecture Hall 1","room":"Lecture Hall 1","note":{},"location":"Charles B.

In this context, one of the most stringent limitations is represented by noise. In fact, the devices currently available are not clean enough to implement complex routines. One of the strategies that can be adopted to face this problem is called quantum error mitigation: the noise configuration of a device is learned as a noise map, which is then used to mitigate the results. In this talk, we present a real-time error mitigation algorithm applicable in the context of optimizing a quantum variational model. In particular, we use the Importance Clifford Sampling method to mitigate both predictions and gradients in a gradient-based optimization procedure. This process is carried out by monitoring the device's noise, so that the noise map is re-learned when the previous one becomes unreliable.\r\nThe routine we describe can easily be extended to any training context and, being problem-agnostic, can be applied to any type of problem addressable with optimization techniques. We present the algorithm and then show promising results obtained by training noisy quantum circuits up to eight qubits.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2816390,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4917066,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796490\/attachments\/2816390\/4917066\/ACAT2024-RealTimeQEM-Robbiati.pdf","title":"ACAT2024-RealTimeQEM-Robbiati.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-11T00:06:36.631975+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"ACAT2024-RealTimeQEM-Robbiati.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":4174396,"checksum":"ddc04867463c8be0825befc290f7632c"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796490\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Matteo","last_name":"Robbiati","fullName":"Robbiati, Matteo","id":"8425676","affiliation":"Universit\u00e0 degli Studi  e INFN Milano (IT)","emailHash":"f10c648da11fa18aebafbb1e81ccafb4","db_id":8425676,"person_id":8054418}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Matteo","last_name":"Robbiati","fullName":"Robbiati, Matteo","id":"8425676","affiliation":"Universit\u00e0 degli Studi  e INFN Milano (IT)","emailHash":"f10c648da11fa18aebafbb1e81ccafb4","db_id":8425676,"person_id":8054418}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alejandro","last_name":"Sopena","fullName":"Sopena, Alejandro","id":"8425679","affiliation":"Instituto de Fisica T\u00e9orica, UAM-CSIC, Universidad Aut\u00f2noma de Madrid, Cantoblanco, Madrid, Spain","emailHash":"c5231958f4ed1e84afa2a14d1e860053","db_id":8425679,"person_id":8055158},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Andrea","last_name":"Papaluca","fullName":"Papaluca, Andrea","id":"8425678","affiliation":"School of Computing, The Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia","emailHash":"1f89acea223e44aecf5ee1d47ae3f235","db_id":8425678,"person_id":8055157},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Stefano","last_name":"Carrazza","fullName":"Carrazza, Stefano","id":"8425677","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"84b1b2e8c091d096ffd7c2cec7636bc1","db_id":8425677,"person_id":8050149}],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","session":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"40","db_id":5796497,"friendly_id":40,"title":"QUnfold: Quantum Annealing for Distributions Unfolding in High-Energy Physics","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"20:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"20:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Lecture Hall 1","room":"Lecture Hall 1","note":{},"location":"Charles B.

The overall effect is that the distribution of each observable measured in a given physical process could be smeared and biased. Unfolding is the statistical technique employed to correct for this distortion and restore the original distribution. This process is essential to make effective comparisons between the outcomes obtained from different experiments and the theoretical predictions.\r\nThe emerging technology of Quantum Computing represents an enticing opportunity to enhance the unfolding performance and potentially yield more accurate results.\r\nThis work introduces QUnfold, a simple Python module designed to address the unfolding challenge by harnessing the capabilities of quantum annealing. In particular, the regularized log-likelihood minimization formulation of the unfolding problem is translated to a Quantum Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, solvable by using quantum annealing systems. The algorithm is validated on a simulated sample of particles collisions data generated combining the Madgraph Monte Carlo event generator and the Delphes simulation software to model the detector response. A variety of fundamental kinematic distributions are unfolded and the results are compared with conventional unfolding algorithms commonly adopted in precision measurements at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN.\r\nThe implementation of the quantum unfolding model relies on the D-Wave Ocean software and the algorithm is run by heuristic classical solvers as well as the physical D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer boasting 5000+ qubits.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2816229,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4918139,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796497\/attachments\/2816229\/4918139\/ACAT2024-QUnfold-Bianco.pdf","title":"ACAT2024-QUnfold-Bianco.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-11T13:05:04.177893+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"ACAT2024-QUnfold-Bianco.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":1056137,"checksum":"b01ade261fd4ed63c2c1244a41e4ac62"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796497\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Gianluca","last_name":"Bianco","fullName":"Bianco, Gianluca","id":"8425714","affiliation":"Universita e INFN, Bologna (IT)","emailHash":"748dede813b2279f29d289558c6838e1","db_id":8425714,"person_id":8100464},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Simone","last_name":"Gasperini","fullName":"Gasperini, Simone","id":"8425713","affiliation":"Universita e INFN, Bologna (IT)","emailHash":"b7fe987a6a5c5c450b48eff97ed4ed1b","db_id":8425713,"person_id":8100462}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Gianluca","last_name":"Bianco","fullName":"Bianco, Gianluca","id":"8425714","affiliation":"Universita e INFN, Bologna (IT)","emailHash":"748dede813b2279f29d289558c6838e1","db_id":8425714,"person_id":8100464},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Simone","last_name":"Gasperini","fullName":"Gasperini, Simone","id":"8425713","affiliation":"Universita e INFN, Bologna (IT)","emailHash":"b7fe987a6a5c5c450b48eff97ed4ed1b","db_id":8425713,"person_id":8100462}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Marco","last_name":"Lorusso","fullName":"Lorusso, Marco","id":"8425712","affiliation":"Universita Di Bologna (IT)","emailHash":"397b00113cdae0e9c31d5698969cf2bd","db_id":8425712,"person_id":8100463}],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","session":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"59","db_id":5796499,"friendly_id":59,"title":"quantum GAN for fast shower simulation","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"19:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"20:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Lecture Hall 1","room":"Lecture Hall 1","note":{},"location":"Charles B.

Such technologies have been especially fruitful for theoretical and experimental physics research where the embarrassingly parallel nature of certain workloads \u2014 e.g., Monte Carlo event generation, detector simulations, workflows, and data analysis \u2014 are exploited to attain significant performance improvements. Despite these capabilities, there still exist an array of problems that are manifestly intractable with classical computation alone, or for which classical computation provides only approximate or inefficient solutions.\r\n\r\nQuantum computing is able to give exponential gains in both time and space for certain classes of problems. However, quantum workloads require significant classical computing support for preprocessing, including optimization and compilation, and postprocessing. This naturally leads to the concept of Quantum-centric Supercomputing (QCSC): the integration of quantum computational devices and high performance computing (HPC) resources. QCSC will leverage quantum and classical computing devices to enable execution of parallel and asynchronous hybrid workloads, unlocking the potential for computations beyond what is currently possible. IBM Quantum is engaging with the scientific and HPC communities to deliver them unrivaled quantum computing capabilities that will play a central role in the most powerful supercomputing systems in the world.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will give a brief overview of IBM Quantum's development roadmap and show how QCSC naturally fits this vision. We will explore ways in which the physics community and computational scientists can benefit from QCSC, and detail use cases suitable for these integrated systems.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2817154,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4918898,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796503\/attachments\/2817154\/4918898\/ACAT2024-qcsc-pascuzzi.pdf","title":"ACAT2024-qcsc-pascuzzi.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-11T18:07:44.147549+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"ACAT2024-qcsc-pascuzzi.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":15981049,"checksum":"a36ededf7283d0d1e43bd78d33914caa"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796503\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Vincent R.","last_name":"Pascuzzi","fullName":"Pascuzzi, Vincent R.","id":"8425732","affiliation":"IBM Quantum","emailHash":"e5a68b6ee32fcfa4b435a1ac83b54ff9","db_id":8425732,"person_id":8198642}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Antonio","last_name":"C\u00f3rcoles","fullName":"C\u00f3rcoles, Antonio","id":"8425733","affiliation":"IBM Quantum","emailHash":"2b406da2e184cc6c70aabb77f0a42451","db_id":8425733,"person_id":8198643},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Vincent R.","last_name":"Pascuzzi","fullName":"Pascuzzi, Vincent R.","id":"8425732","affiliation":"IBM Quantum","emailHash":"e5a68b6ee32fcfa4b435a1ac83b54ff9","db_id":8425732,"person_id":8198642}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","session":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"119","db_id":5796502,"friendly_id":119,"title":"Advancing Image Classification using Intel SDK: Integrating NAQSS Encoding with Hybrid Quantum-Classical PQC Models","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"21:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"22:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Lecture Hall 1","room":"Lecture Hall 1","note":{},"location":"Charles B.

As the future revolutionary technology, quantum computing opens a grand new perspective in the art area. Using Quantum Machine Learning (QML), the current work explores the utilization of Normal Arbitrary Quantum Superposition State (NAQSS) for encoding images into a quantum circuit. The learning of trainable parameters for image classification is achieved through the use of layers of Parameterized Quantum Circuit (PQC) with a hybrid optimizer. Starting with the simplest example i.e. 2x2-colored images, the accuracy has been improved with the increasing size of the images, as the circuit depth increases linearly with the image size namely quantum gates. The potential of QML and parameters influencing accuracy are extensively investigated. The implementations have been carried out using the Intel Quantum SDK (Software Development Kit), based on the research within the framework of cooperation between Intel Labs and Deggendorf Institute of Technology.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2816484,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4918942,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796502\/attachments\/2816484\/4918942\/ACAT_AdvancingQIP_DigvijaysinhAjarekar.pdf","title":"ACAT_AdvancingQIP_DigvijaysinhAjarekar.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-11T19:45:36.778396+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"ACAT_AdvancingQIP_DigvijaysinhAjarekar.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":1414460,"checksum":"9a27184c931ff18f8fb81f7f051b15f0"},{"_type":"attachment","id":4918941,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796502\/attachments\/2816484\/4918941\/ACAT_AdvancingQIP_DigvijaysinhAjarekar.pptx","title":"ACAT_AdvancingQIP_DigvijaysinhAjarekar.pptx","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-11T19:45:21.626228+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"ACAT_AdvancingQIP_DigvijaysinhAjarekar.pptx","content_type":"application\/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation","size":14805205,"checksum":"a49a6cca8a4b630bd3281ea57635722e"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796502\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Digvijaysinh","last_name":"Ajarekar","fullName":"Ajarekar, Digvijaysinh","id":"8425730","affiliation":"Deggendorf Institute of Technology","emailHash":"f6ab2c82a39b130afb1a422b179e4c9c","db_id":8425730,"person_id":8165550}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Digvijaysinh","last_name":"Ajarekar","fullName":"Ajarekar, Digvijaysinh","id":"8425730","affiliation":"Deggendorf Institute of Technology","emailHash":"f6ab2c82a39b130afb1a422b179e4c9c","db_id":8425730,"person_id":8165550},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Suhaib","last_name":"Al-Rousan","fullName":"Al-Rousan, Suhaib","id":"8425731","affiliation":"Deggendorf Institute of Technology","emailHash":"a39f9e23684e958ef478416c975093af","db_id":8425731,"person_id":8165549},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Helena","last_name":"Liebelt","fullName":"Liebelt, Helena","id":"8425729","affiliation":"Deggendorf Institute of Technology","emailHash":"398bf374a2706c15c78aec669145e104","db_id":8425729,"person_id":8165551},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Rui","last_name":"Li","fullName":"Li, Rui","id":"8425728","affiliation":"Deggendorf Institute of Technology","emailHash":"293b84efa351a6d554bfd43fdedba2a4","db_id":8425728,"person_id":8165552}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","session":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"192","db_id":5812806,"friendly_id":192,"title":"Modern Machine Learning Tools for Unfolding","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-12","time":"16:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-12","time":"17:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"","room":"","note":{},"location":"Remote","type":"Oral","description":"Unfolding is a transformative method that is key to analyze LHC data.

Wang Center, Stony Brook University","type":"Poster","description":"Traditionally, data centers provide computing services to the outside world, and their security policies are usually separated from the outside world based on firewalls and other security defense boundaries. Users access the data center intranet through VPN, and individuals or endpoints connected through remote methods receive a higher level of trust to use computing services than individuals or endpoints outside the perimeter. But this approach to security design is never ideal. Zero Trust security is based on de-peripheralization and least-privilege access, which protects intranet assets and services from vulnerabilities inherent in the network perimeter and implicit trust architecture. In order to meet the diverse data analysis needs of light source users, the HEPS scientific computing system provides an interactive computing service model for external network users. Users can directly access intranet computing resources through web pages. In this service model, how do we refer to the zero-trust security idea? It has become very urgent to realize the minimum permission access between various services of the computing system and improve the security level of the system environment. Based on the zero-trust security strategy, this paper designs an inter-service communication mechanism based on user identity tokens. During the function call process between different services, service permissions are allocated based on the token user identity to achieve fine-grained management of service permissions and ensure the Cybersecurity of HEPS scientific computing systems.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2820196,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4924547,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796847\/attachments\/2820196\/4924547\/chep%202024-poster.pdf","title":"chep 2024-poster.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-14T15:16:13.116294+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"chep 2024-poster.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":174458,"checksum":"aaf7a866c246c07b1c5e02e86be09afe"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796847\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Qingbao","last_name":"Hu","fullName":"Hu, Qingbao","id":"8426781","affiliation":"IHEP","emailHash":"14e8920bd797199d6262d635a095047e","db_id":8426781,"person_id":8105259}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jiping","last_name":"Xu","fullName":"Xu, Jiping","id":"8426782","affiliation":"IHEP","emailHash":"1955e867dc0a5cc0c3ed6efc542274d7","db_id":8426782,"person_id":8105257},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Qingbao","last_name":"Hu","fullName":"Hu, Qingbao","id":"8426781","affiliation":"IHEP","emailHash":"14e8920bd797199d6262d635a095047e","db_id":8426781,"person_id":8105259},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Yaosong","last_name":"Cheng","fullName":"Cheng, Yaosong","id":"8426783","affiliation":"Institute of High Energy Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences, IHEP","emailHash":"4235bebccbad199edc13f8edfe4005bb","db_id":8426783,"person_id":8105258},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"qi","last_name":"luo","fullName":"luo, qi","id":"8426784","affiliation":"\u4e2d\u79d1\u9662\u9ad8\u80fd\u7269\u7406\u6240\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u5fc3","emailHash":"6c94f0c5c29dc8d8b86046cf7288c153","db_id":8426784,"person_id":8105260}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 2: Data Analysis - Algorithms and Tools","session":"Poster session with coffee break","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"100","db_id":5796636,"friendly_id":100,"title":"Using Legacy ATLAS C++ Calibration Tools in Modern Columnar Analysis Environments","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-14","time":"21:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-14","time":"21:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":30,"roomFullname":"","room":"","note":{},"location":"Charles B.

However, these tools face compatibility challenges with the columnar analysis paradigm that operates on many events at once in Python\/Awkward or RDataFrame environments. Those challenges arise due to the intricate nature of certain tools, as a result of years of continuous development, and the necessity to support a diverse range of compute environments. In this contribution, we present the ATLAS R&D efforts to adapt these legacy tools to be used in both event-loop and columnar environments with minimal code modifications. This approach enables on-the-fly calibration and uncertainties calculations, minimizing the reliance on intermediate data storage. We demonstrate the functionality and performance of this approach in a Python Jupyter notebook that reproduces a toy Z-boson-peak analysis.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2819447,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4923081,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796636\/attachments\/2819447\/4923081\/ACAT_poster_A0.pdf","title":"ACAT_poster_A0.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-13T21:09:12.354949+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"ACAT_poster_A0.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":3136394,"checksum":"e4a615b3c0b3a62cc128919bc6e1ff11"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796636\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Matthias","last_name":"Vigl","fullName":"Vigl, Matthias","id":"8426250","affiliation":"Technische Universitat Munchen (DE)","emailHash":"c630dca3f8fc54fa3c4a075ca32ea8aa","db_id":8426250,"person_id":8102779}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Giordon Holtsberg","last_name":"Stark","fullName":"Stark, Giordon Holtsberg","id":"8426257","affiliation":"University of California,Santa Cruz (US)","emailHash":"ea65f40376d53f2ee5eea5931737cb0f","db_id":8426257,"person_id":8157514},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Lukas Alexander","last_name":"Heinrich","fullName":"Heinrich, Lukas Alexander","id":"8426258","affiliation":"Technische Universitat Munchen (DE)","emailHash":"fd0f8bf65da577a884b4bb1260da8d60","db_id":8426258,"person_id":8102778},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Matthew","last_name":"Feickert","fullName":"Feickert, Matthew","id":"8426255","affiliation":"University of Wisconsin Madison (US)","emailHash":"fef688a25ce02bfe5af6a307d21f90e9","db_id":8426255,"person_id":8157515},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Matthias","last_name":"Vigl","fullName":"Vigl, Matthias","id":"8426250","affiliation":"Technische Universitat Munchen (DE)","emailHash":"c630dca3f8fc54fa3c4a075ca32ea8aa","db_id":8426250,"person_id":8102779},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Nils Erik","last_name":"Krumnack","fullName":"Krumnack, Nils Erik","id":"8426251","affiliation":"Iowa State University (US)","emailHash":"9aa8aab852d2208db54db51d005243a7","db_id":8426251,"person_id":8157517},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Vangelis","last_name":"Kourlitis","fullName":"Kourlitis, Vangelis","id":"8426256","affiliation":"Technische Universitat Munchen (DE)","emailHash":"b061138d24fbf258717fc5cf0b46ddcb","db_id":8426256,"person_id":8157518}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alexander","last_name":"Held","fullName":"Held, Alexander","id":"8426252","affiliation":"University of Wisconsin Madison (US)","emailHash":"fed5998fb15c9323f97c094991d6da70","db_id":8426252,"person_id":8157516},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Gordon","last_name":"Watts","fullName":"Watts, Gordon","id":"8426254","affiliation":"University of Washington (US)","emailHash":"53faef883b37fb4dc03d02269b5a4401","db_id":8426254,"person_id":8105319},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Nikolai","last_name":"Hartmann","fullName":"Hartmann, Nikolai","id":"8426253","affiliation":"Ludwig Maximilians Universitat (DE)","emailHash":"5424b4788471244aeada1c97d9aa6670","db_id":8426253,"person_id":8157513}],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","session":"Poster session with coffee break","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"82","db_id":5796848,"friendly_id":82,"title":"Design and Implementation of a Container-based Public Service Cloud Platform for HEPS","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-14","time":"21:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-14","time":"21:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":30,"roomFullname":"","room":"","note":{},"location":"Charles B.

However, traditional physical server-based deployment methods suffer from issues such as low resource utilization, limited scalability, and high maintenance costs.Therefore, the objective of this study is to design and develop a container-based public service cloud platform that caters to the experimental and application needs of synchrotron radiation sources. By leveraging Kubernetes as the container orchestration technology, the platform achieves elastic scalability, multi-tenancy support, and dynamic resource allocation, thereby enhancing resource utilization and system scalability. Furthermore, incorporating robust security measures such as access control, authentication, and data encryption ensures the safety and integrity of users' applications and data.This research also focuses on the design, application, and deployment of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CICD). By implementing CICD workflows, the platform automates the build, testing, and deployment processes of applications, resulting in improved efficiency and quality throughout the development and deployment lifecycle.HEPS Container Public Service Cloud offers a comprehensive range of services including ganglia and nagios monitoring, puppet, cluster login nodes, nginx proxy, user service system, LADP and AD domain authentication nodes, KRB5 slave nodes, and more.The research findings demonstrate that the container-based public service cloud design and application deliver high-performance, stable, and secure services, effectively meeting the demands of synchrotron radiation source experiments and applications. Additionally, the utilization of CICD further enhances the efficiency and quality of development and deployment processes. Future work should focus on optimizing and expanding the capabilities of the container-based public service cloud to accommodate diverse user requirements and scenarios.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796848\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"lei","last_name":"wang","fullName":"wang, lei","id":"8501252","affiliation":"Institute of High Energy Physics","emailHash":"1d61988cc8f20a80b0ad59718977f31c","db_id":8501252,"person_id":8103389}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Fazhi","last_name":"Qi","fullName":"Qi, Fazhi","id":"8426787","affiliation":"IHEP, CAS","emailHash":null,"db_id":8426787,"person_id":8070577},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jiping","last_name":"Xu","fullName":"Xu, Jiping","id":"8426788","affiliation":"IHEP","emailHash":"1955e867dc0a5cc0c3ed6efc542274d7","db_id":8426788,"person_id":8105257},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Qingbao","last_name":"Hu","fullName":"Hu, Qingbao","id":"8426785","affiliation":"IHEP, CAS","emailHash":null,"db_id":8426785,"person_id":8070579},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Wei","last_name":"Zheng","fullName":"Zheng, Wei","id":"8426786","affiliation":"IHEP","emailHash":"7fda80a730a2063a5105fc8939a2f5e5","db_id":8426786,"person_id":8104515}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 2: Data Analysis - Algorithms and Tools","session":"Poster session with coffee break","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"13","db_id":5796493,"friendly_id":13,"title":"Supervised job preemption methodology for controlled memory consumption of jobs running in the ALICE Grid","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-13","time":"21:15:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-13","time":"21:45:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":30,"roomFullname":"","room":"","note":{},"location":"Charles B. Wang Center, Stony Brook University","type":"Poster","description":"The ALICE experiment's Grid resources vary significantly in terms of memory capacity, CPU cores, and resource management. Memory allocation for scheduled jobs depends on the hardware constraints of the executing machines, system configurations, and batch queuing policies. The O2 software framework introduces multi-core tasks where deployed processes share resources. To accommodate these new use cases, most Grid sites provide ALICE with multi-core slots of a customizable amount of cores. The Grid middleware manages the resources within a slot, sub-partitioning and distributing them among allocated jobs. This allows for parallel execution of jobs with different natures and usage patterns within the same resource-sharing slot. From the scheduling system's perspective, this job set is treated as a single unit for resource usage accounting. Overconsumption by any job can lead to the entire slot being killed, terminating all co-executing ALICE jobs. To prevent this and promote job completion with reasonable resource usage, the Grid middleware should implement targeted preemption of top-consuming jobs when overall consumption approaches the system's killing threshold.\r\n\r\nThis paper analyzes site resource limiting procedures, including killing policies and memory thresholds, and the design of the ALICE Grid middleware framework's methodology for targeted preemption. Preemption decisions are made in real time, considering various factors of running payloads, weighted according to experiment priorities, to maximize efficiency and successful task completion.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2813803,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4911650,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796493\/attachments\/2813803\/4911650\/ACAT2024Bertran.pdf","title":"ACAT2024Bertran.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-06T07:56:05.043497+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"ACAT2024Bertran.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":1021106,"checksum":"9e777df9d20de14ef881e7cc2be167bd"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796493\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Kalana","last_name":"Wijethunga","fullName":"Wijethunga, Kalana","id":"8504228","affiliation":"University of Moratuwa (LK)","emailHash":"4e177952af1a7b0c31cb6a731ec822d6","db_id":8504228,"person_id":8065232}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Kalana","last_name":"Wijethunga","fullName":"Wijethunga, Kalana","id":"8504228","affiliation":"University of Moratuwa (LK)","emailHash":"4e177952af1a7b0c31cb6a731ec822d6","db_id":8504228,"person_id":8065232},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Marta","last_name":"Bertran Ferrer","fullName":"Bertran Ferrer, Marta","id":"8425687","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"52a8825d6326c1b1c5a615507a596723","db_id":8425687,"person_id":8073581}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","session":"Poster session with coffee break","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"186","db_id":5796662,"friendly_id":186,"title":"Low Latency, High Bandwidth Streaming of Experimental Data with EJFAT","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"20:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"21:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Theatre","room":"Theatre","note":{},"location":" Charles B.

However, the process is complicated by the challenges associated with data provisioning and migration, impacting the ease of workflow migration and deployment. Transitioning from traditional file-based batch processing to data-stream processing workflows is suggested as a method to streamline these workflows. This transition not only simplifies file provisioning and migration but also significantly reduces the necessity for extensive disk space. Data-stream processing is particularly effective for real-time processing during data acquisition, thereby enhancing data quality assurance. This paper introduces the integration of the JLAB CLAS12 event reconstruction application within the ERSAP data-stream processing framework that facilitates the execution of streaming event reconstruction at a remote data center and enables the return streaming of reconstructed events to JLAB while circumventing the need for temporary data storage throughout the process.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2816500,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4917082,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796651\/attachments\/2816500\/4917082\/clas12-gyurjyan.pdf","title":"clas12-gyurjyan.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-11T01:02:02.222774+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"clas12-gyurjyan.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":4949374,"checksum":"89c5461885791bd1b7b64f009b62a5a4"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796651\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Vardan","last_name":"Gyurjyan","fullName":"Gyurjyan, Vardan","id":"8426326","affiliation":"","emailHash":"d96010739664021f1bf2e72848130026","db_id":8426326,"person_id":8161849}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Vardan","last_name":"Gyurjyan","fullName":"Gyurjyan, Vardan","id":"8426326","affiliation":"","emailHash":"d96010739664021f1bf2e72848130026","db_id":8426326,"person_id":8161849}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Carl","last_name":"Timmer","fullName":"Timmer, Carl","id":"8426321","affiliation":"","emailHash":"de4c9c91bdcf02a335a4790240b2d7f7","db_id":8426321,"person_id":8185251},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"David","last_name":"Lawrence","fullName":"Lawrence, David","id":"8426324","affiliation":"","emailHash":"762fb4d3bf38cd850e9b1a0a217d217e","db_id":8426324,"person_id":8161850},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Derek","last_name":"Howard","fullName":"Howard, Derek","id":"8426329","affiliation":"","emailHash":"a73f0b2c07223f76a66c2c30b4de7382","db_id":8426329,"person_id":8185252},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Graham","last_name":"Heyes","fullName":"Heyes, Graham","id":"8426327","affiliation":"Jefferson Lab","emailHash":"4d5d774fbc10428666aa35dfe8e65f1e","db_id":8426327,"person_id":8161851},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jeng-Yuan","last_name":"Tsai","fullName":"Tsai, Jeng-Yuan","id":"8426325","affiliation":"","emailHash":"8ef1894555b681c53bcb31436b355cf9","db_id":8426325,"person_id":8161848},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Goodrich","fullName":"Goodrich, Michael","id":"8426328","affiliation":"","emailHash":"0314d1a929136f81bb9e49ef1d9802b1","db_id":8426328,"person_id":8185249},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Nicholas","last_name":"Tyler","fullName":"Tyler, Nicholas","id":"8426322","affiliation":"","emailHash":"91c5d6613ceed01cc8d4fad6bb694c02","db_id":8426322,"person_id":8185250},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Stacey","last_name":"Sheldon","fullName":"Sheldon, Stacey","id":"8426323","affiliation":"","emailHash":"b6044aca0e441424bca45035a50cf052","db_id":8426323,"person_id":8185248},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Yatish","last_name":"Kumar","fullName":"Kumar, Yatish","id":"8426330","affiliation":"","emailHash":"e7e7fc06cf7c68706e151f7568d27264","db_id":8426330,"person_id":8185247}],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","session":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"25","db_id":5796505,"friendly_id":25,"title":"HEP Benchmark Suite: Enhancing Efficiency and Sustainability in Worldwide LHC Computing Infrastructures","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"20:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"20:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Theatre","room":"Theatre","note":{},"location":" Charles B.

This responsibility extends to the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG), encompassing over 170 sites in 40 countries, supporting vital computing, disk, and tape storage for LHC experiments. Ensuring efficient operational practices across these diverse sites is crucial beyond mere performance metrics.\r\n\r\nThis paper introduces the HEP Benchmark suite, an enhanced suite designed to measure computing resource performance uniformly across all WLCG sites, using HEPScore23 as performance unit. The suite expands beyond assessing only the execution speed via HEPScore23. In fact the suite incorporates metrics such as machine load, memory usage, memory swap, and notably, power consumption. Its adaptability and user-friendly interface enable comprehensive acquisition of system-related data alongside benchmarking.\r\n\r\nThroughout 2023, this tool underwent rigorous testing across numerous WLCG sites. The focus was on studying compute job slot performance and correlating these with fabric metrics. Initial analysis unveiled the tool's efficacy in establishing a standardized model for compute resource utilization while pinpointing anomalies, often stemming from site misconfigurations.\r\n\r\nThis paper aims to elucidate the tool's functionality and present the results obtained from extensive testing. By disseminating this information, the objective is to raise awareness within the community about this probing model, fostering broader adoption and encouraging responsible computing practices that prioritize both performance and environmental impact mitigation.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2817033,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4918181,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796505\/attachments\/2817033\/4918181\/ACAT2024-Enhanced_HEPScore_Benchmark_Suite-Szczepanek.pdf","title":"ACAT2024-Enhanced_HEPScore_Benchmark_Suite-Szczepanek.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-11T13:30:58.783919+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"ACAT2024-Enhanced_HEPScore_Benchmark_Suite-Szczepanek.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":5942849,"checksum":"a6fa3fb5e4ba8ab169474195b864ba30"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796505\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Natalia Diana","last_name":"Szczepanek","fullName":"Szczepanek, Natalia Diana","id":"8425740","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"10fca179c514493b2efafa17f9397145","db_id":8425740,"person_id":8096436}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Natalia Diana","last_name":"Szczepanek","fullName":"Szczepanek, Natalia Diana","id":"8425740","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"10fca179c514493b2efafa17f9397145","db_id":8425740,"person_id":8096436},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Domenico","last_name":"Giordano","fullName":"Giordano, Domenico","id":"8425738","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"0cb6ba9ae68e30d8bf3ef4a3e0f294c2","db_id":8425738,"person_id":8096434}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Ladislav","last_name":"Ondris","fullName":"Ondris, Ladislav","id":"8425741","affiliation":"Brno University of Technology (CZ)","emailHash":"dc9265509557321fff85a7ec5e45958b","db_id":8425741,"person_id":8096433},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Ewoud","last_name":"Ketele","fullName":"Ketele, Ewoud","id":"8425739","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"531f4256a08c061ed58f7aec092287f7","db_id":8425739,"person_id":8096432},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Gonzalo","last_name":"Menendez Borge","fullName":"Menendez Borge, Gonzalo","id":"8425743","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"e0eaccd3cdc62d941e01764a37701b19","db_id":8425743,"person_id":8096437},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alessandro","last_name":"Di Girolamo","fullName":"Di Girolamo, Alessandro","id":"8425742","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"a0dd1a3a7589f1e2a04cc967f2ae6c39","db_id":8425742,"person_id":8096435},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Ivan","last_name":"Glushkov","fullName":"Glushkov, Ivan","id":"8425744","affiliation":"University of Texas at Arlington (US)","emailHash":"fa4b98ff2babf0afd4594226775ea675","db_id":8425744,"person_id":8096431}],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","session":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"22","db_id":5796496,"friendly_id":22,"title":"A Function-As-Task Workflow Management Approach with PanDA and iDDS","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"19:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"20:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Theatre","room":"Theatre","note":{},"location":" Charles B.

It\u2019s important and useful to have a tool to automate these diverse steps efficiently.\r\nWith the Production and Distributed Analysis (PanDA) system and the intelligent Data Delivery Service (iDDS), we provide a platform for coordinating sequences of tasks with a workflow, orchestrating the seamless execution of tasks in a specified order and under predefined conditions, in order to automate the task sequence. In this presentation, we will present our efforts, beginning with an overview of the platform's architecture. We'll then describe a user-friendly interface with workflows described in python and tasks described by python functions. Next, we detail the flow to transform python functions into tasks and schedule tasks to distributed heterogeneous resources, coupled with a messaging-based asynchronous result-processing mechanism. Finally, we'll showcase a practical example illustrating how this platform effectively converts a machine learning hyperparameter optimization processing on an ATLAS ttH analysis to a distributed

JUNO will start to take data in the fall of 2024 with 2PB data each year. It is important that raw data is copied to permanent storage and distributed to multiple data center storage system in time for backup. To make available for re-reconstruction among these data centers, raw data also need to be registered into metadata and replicas catalogs of the JUNO distributed computing system. The raw data management system will take care of distributing raw data and running data processing activities in JUNO data centers. An automatic system based on JUNO distributed computing system has been designed and developed to do registering, replicating, archiving and data reconstruction in a data-driven chain. The monitoring dashboard has been designed and developed to ensure the quality of data transfer and processing. The prototype of the system has been tested with commissioning data in 2023 and the system will continue to join JUNO data challenge in early 2024.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2816509,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4917094,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796489\/attachments\/2816509\/4917094\/ACAT2024-JUNO%20raw%20data%20management-zhang.pdf","title":"ACAT2024-JUNO raw data management-zhang.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-11T04:02:15.758353+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"ACAT2024-JUNO raw data management-zhang.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":1536137,"checksum":"870f8abe4cc991622ccc2330f17628ed"},{"_type":"attachment","id":4923580,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796489\/attachments\/2816509\/4923580\/ACAT2024-JUNO%20raw%20data%20management-zhang-summary.pdf","title":"ACAT2024-JUNO raw data management-zhang-summary.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-14T09:20:35.001080+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"ACAT2024-JUNO raw data management-zhang-summary.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":249562,"checksum":"dadfb8982b18eea1c31ed7bf2bb9b534"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796489\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Xiaomei","last_name":"Zhang","fullName":"Zhang, Xiaomei","id":"8425675","affiliation":"Chinese Academy of Sciences (CN)","emailHash":"8b3ba966214d1bb40cdf7b7877d43972","db_id":8425675,"person_id":8026122}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Xiaomei","last_name":"Zhang","fullName":"Zhang, Xiaomei","id":"8425675","affiliation":"Chinese Academy of Sciences (CN)","emailHash":"8b3ba966214d1bb40cdf7b7877d43972","db_id":8425675,"person_id":8026122}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","session":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"63","db_id":5796591,"friendly_id":63,"title":"CaloDiT: Diffusion with transformers for fast shower simulation","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-13","time":"22:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-13","time":"22:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Theatre","room":"Theatre","note":{},"location":" Charles B.

Additionally, when given enough data, transformers can learn better representations than other deep learning models thanks to the absence of inductive bias, better modelling of long-range dependencies, and interpolation and extrapolation capabilities. On the other hand, diffusion models are the state-of-the-art approach for image generation, which still use conventional U-net models for generation, mostly consisting of convolution layers making little use of the advantages of transformers. While these models show good generation performance it lacks the generalisation capabilities obtained from the transformer model.  Standard diffusion models with an Unet architecture have already proven to be able to generate calorimeter showers, while transformer-based models, like those based on a VQ-VAE architecture, also show promising results. A combination of a diffusion model with a transformer architecture should bridge the quality of the generation sample obtained from diffusion with the generalisation capabilities of the transformer architecture. In this paper, we propose CaloDiT, to model our problem as a diffusion process with transformer blocks. Furthermore, we show the ability of the model to generalise to different calorimeter geometries, bringing us closer to a foundation model for calorimeter shower generation.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2819423,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4923033,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796591\/attachments\/2819423\/4923033\/CaloDiT%20ACAT%2024%20(1).pdf","title":"CaloDiT

The tools are deployed in a heterogeneous simulation infrastructure known as the Integrated Simulation Framework (ISF), which was originally developed over a decade ago. While ISF allows for a flexible combination of simulation tools, it has accumulated a significant level of complexity over the last few years and is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain by the collaboration. In addition, the complex particle routing algorithms implemented by ISF have been found to cause a measurable overhead in the simulation time. At the same time, recent advances in Geant4 may allow a complete replacement of ISF by outsourcing its entire functionality as a particle stack dispatcher to the Geant4 toolkit.\r\n\r\nThis talk presents a first implementation of FastCaloSimV2 as a Geant4 fast simulation model. FastCaloSimV2 provides a fast parametric simulation of the ATLAS calorimeter and is part of the state-of-the-art fast simulation tool AtlFast3. Its integration into Geant4 will serve as a reference for the integration of other simulators, which is expected to significantly streamline the simulation infrastructure of the ATLAS experiment in the coming years.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2819033,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4922263,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796541\/attachments\/2819033\/4922263\/Beirer_ACAT2024.pdf","title":"Beirer_ACAT2024.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-13T13:02:22.415626+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"Beirer_ACAT2024.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":25393342,"checksum":"2d142e405415d19bcd7afac117abee4f"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796541\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Joshua Falco","last_name":"Beirer","fullName":"Beirer, Joshua Falco","id":"8425858","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"c0f2823d4969bfc536ce9cf25b438e22","db_id":8425858,"person_id":8097274}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Joshua Falco","last_name":"Beirer","fullName":"Beirer, Joshua Falco","id":"8425858","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"c0f2823d4969bfc536ce9cf25b438e22","db_id":8425858,"person_id":8097274}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","session":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"169","db_id":5796652,"friendly_id":169,"title":"Effective denoising diffusion probabilistic models for fast and high fidelity whole-event simulation in high-energy heavy-ion experiment","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-14","time":"20:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-14","time":"21:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Theatre","room":"Theatre","note":{},"location":" Charles B.

However, they have several drawbacks such as training instability and unable to cover the entire data distribution especially for the region where data are rare. This is particularly challenging for whole-event full-detector simulations in the high-energy heavy-ion experiments, such as sPHENIX at RHIC and LHC experiments, where thousands of particles are produced per event and interact through the detector. AI-based surrogate models need to reproduce short-range and long-range patterns, and their energy spread, all of which stems from the evolution of the quark-gluon plasma produced in the collisions and its detector response. \r\n\r\nHere, we investigate the effectiveness of denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) as an AI-based generative surrogate model for sPHENIX experiment that include both the heavy ion event generation and its response in the whole calorimeter stack. DDPM, a new type of AI generative model, underpins the recent generative AI success such as Stable Diffusion and Mid-Journey. For photographic images and arts, it can outperform previous generative models in image quality, data diversity and training stability. We study its performance in sPHENIX data compared with a popular rival \u2013 GANs.  Our results show that both DDPM and GAN can reproduce the data distribution where the examples are abundant (low to medium tower energies). But DDPM significantly outperforms GANs in overall distribution distance and high-tower energy regions, where events are rare. The results are consistent between both central and peripheral centrality heavy ion collision events.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2820287,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4924742,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796652\/attachments\/2820287\/4924742\/20240313_ACAT_Yeonju.pdf","title":"20240313_ACAT_Yeonju.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-14T16:47:33.530296+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"20240313_ACAT_Yeonju.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":66051026,"checksum":"47c650b67651c582646b0cfa6cfc1020"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796652\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Yeonju","last_name":"Go","fullName":"Go, Yeonju","id":"8426334","affiliation":"Brookhaven National Laboratory (US)","emailHash":"733954850ea550f91deb6269af9e4da5","db_id":8426334,"person_id":8188541}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Dmitrii","last_name":"Torbunov","fullName":"Torbunov, Dmitrii","id":"8426332","affiliation":"","emailHash":"ff46a5e5d18ccd060038cf4af121a523","db_id":8426332,"person_id":8165613},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jin","last_name":"Huang","fullName":"Huang, Jin","id":"8426331","affiliation":"Brookhaven National Lab","emailHash":"ed1a76b6b45733398a0cf74409943bbe","db_id":8426331,"person_id":8188542},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Timothy Thomas","last_name":"Rinn","fullName":"Rinn, Timothy Thomas","id":"8426335","affiliation":"Brookhaven National Laboratory","emailHash":"92077e6a1a544f9c37dbf5b585654d38","db_id":8426335,"person_id":8188540},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Yeonju","last_name":"Go","fullName":"Go, Yeonju","id":"8426334","affiliation":"Brookhaven National Laboratory (US)","emailHash":"733954850ea550f91deb6269af9e4da5","db_id":8426334,"person_id":8188541},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Yihui","last_name":"Ren","fullName":"Ren, Yihui","id":"8426333","affiliation":"","emailHash":"b58e3692c2edcf4c7aa258a133c01e82","db_id":8426333,"person_id":8188543}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","session":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"44","db_id":5796573,"friendly_id":44,"title":"Deep learning methods for noise filtering in the NA61\/SHINE experiment.","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-14","time":"20:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-14","time":"20:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Theatre","room":"Theatre","note":{},"location":" Charles B. Wang Center, Stony Brook University ","type":"Oral","description":"The NA61\/SHINE experiment is a prominent venture in high-energy physics, located at the SPS accelerator within CERN. Recently, the experiment's physics program has been extended, which necessitated the upgrade of detector hardware and software for new physics purposes.\r\n\r\nThe upgrade included a fundamental modification of the readout electronics (front-end) in the detecting system core of the NA61\/SHINE, namely the time projection chambers (TPCs). This improvement increased data flow rates, raising them from 80 Hz to 1.7 kHz.\r\n\r\nIn light of the significant increase in the amount of data collected, it has become necessary to implement an online noise filtering tool.\r\n\r\nTraditionally, this task has relied on the reconstruction of particle tracks and the subsequent removal of clusters that lack association with any discernible particle trajectory. However, it's important to acknowledge that this method consumes a noteworthy amount of time and computational resources.\r\n\r\nIn the year 2022, the initial dataset was collected through the utilization of the upgraded detector system. In relation to this data, a collection of machine learning models was developed, employing two distinct categories of neural networks: dense and convolutional networks (DNN, CNN). Of utmost significance is the seamless integration of these trained models into the existing NA61\/SHINE C++ software framework, utilizing the capabilities of the TensorFlow C++ library. Furthermore, to facilitate easier deployment, containerization using Docker was applied. It is production ready.\r\n\r\nThis presentation aims to unveil the results attained through the application of these algorithms for noise reduction, encompassing training times for both CNN and DNN models, post-filtering data reconstruction duration, and the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis of the CNN-filtered data. During this presentation, we intend to unveil the outcomes yielded by the application of these algorithms for noise filtration. Additionally, we will delve into the time performance of these models, offering insights into various pertinent metrics.\r\n\r\nWe will compare the results of reference invariant mass spectra generated with and without the ML noise rejection and draw the conclusions on the influence of employed ML methods on the physical results.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2820159,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4924835,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796573\/attachments\/2820159\/4924835\/ACAT2024Slides-14-03.pdf","title":"ACAT2024Slides-14-03.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-14T18:13:09.607315+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"ACAT2024Slides-14-03.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":4548533,"checksum":"e388a76b0d6402d5d663f81632ea7c96"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796573\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Katarzyna","last_name":"Schmidt","fullName":"Schmidt, Katarzyna","id":"8425930","affiliation":"University of Silesia (PL)","emailHash":"ab57726bdb1cc0eef5074eac5c78f559","db_id":8425930,"person_id":8102469}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Katarzyna","last_name":"Schmidt","fullName":"Schmidt, Katarzyna","id":"8425930","affiliation":"University of Silesia (PL)","emailHash":"ab57726bdb1cc0eef5074eac5c78f559","db_id":8425930,"person_id":8102469},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Wojciech","last_name":"Brylinski","fullName":"Brylinski, Wojciech","id":"8425927","affiliation":"Warsaw University of Technology (PL)","emailHash":"579a61551c80ec7df5d122d604e0674e","db_id":8425927,"person_id":8102467},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Kordian","last_name":"Makulski","fullName":"Makulski, Kordian","id":"8425926","affiliation":"Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland","emailHash":"8e8d774db7bce2e4069590a257acb9ae","db_id":8425926,"person_id":8102470},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Marcin","last_name":"Slodkowski","fullName":"Slodkowski, Marcin","id":"8425928","affiliation":"Warsaw University of Technology (PL)","emailHash":"cf6dc3948183c7758e181e42e3d2b093","db_id":8425928,"person_id":8102466},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Oskar","last_name":"Wyszynski","fullName":"Wyszynski, Oskar","id":"8425929","affiliation":"Jan Kochanowski University (PL)","emailHash":"5420c893368546f05fea5da2ffa13419","db_id":8425929,"person_id":8102468}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","session":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"181","db_id":5796660,"friendly_id":181,"title":"First experiences with the LHCb heterogeneous software trigger","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-14","time":"22:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-14","time":"23:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Theatre","room":"Theatre","note":{},"location":" Charles B.

This system will include a Level-0 (L0) trigger based on custom electronics and firmware, and a high-level software trigger running on off-the-shelf hardware. The upgraded L0 trigger system uses information from the calorimeters and the muon trigger detectors. Once information from all muon trigger sectors has been received, trigger candidate multiplicities are calculated by the Muon-to-Central-Trigger-Processor Interface (MUCTPI). Muon multiplicity information is sent to the Central-Trigger-Processor (CTP) and trigger objects are sent to the L0 Global Trigger Processor (L0Global). In Phase 2, the CTP will be a newly designed and custom-built electronics system, based on the ATCA standard. It will employ a System-on-Chip (SoC) and optical serial inputs to receive trigger information from the Global Trigger and the MUCTPI system. The control and monitoring software run directly on the SoC, while the trigger logic runs on an FPGA. The CTP will need to allow a set of 1024 trigger items based on 1024 usable single-bit inputs, requiring updates in the trigger logic implementation, as well as the software for compiling the trigger conditions into FPGA configuration files. New features will also be introduced, such as delayed triggers. We will present the design and status of the Phase 2 L0CT system and its new features, including a view of the pilot Phase 1 upgrade, which paves the way for the upcoming upgrades.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2819444,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4923077,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796581\/attachments\/2819444\/4923077\/Koulouris_ACAT2024_L1CT_phase2_v2.pdf","title":"Koulouris_ACAT2024_L1CT_phase2_v2.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-13T21:04:41.878201+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"Koulouris_ACAT2024_L1CT_phase2_v2.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":2011247,"checksum":"1abf5385eb9e0bd124884ebc8158370e"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796581\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Aimilianos","last_name":"Koulouris","fullName":"Koulouris, Aimilianos","id":"8498271","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"f9b16daa9ad4c4b4d59d68c62a42fa36","db_id":8498271,"person_id":8280241}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Aimilianos","last_name":"Koulouris","fullName":"Koulouris, Aimilianos","id":"8498271","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"f9b16daa9ad4c4b4d59d68c62a42fa36","db_id":8498271,"person_id":8280241},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alexander","last_name":"Oh","fullName":"Oh, Alexander","id":"8425977","affiliation":"University of Manchester (GB)","emailHash":"c04174695d6059bcc97fc933169c2a0b","db_id":8425977,"person_id":8103936}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","session":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"78","db_id":5796588,"friendly_id":78,"title":"Fair Universe: HiggsML Uncertainty Challenge","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-12","time":"17:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-12","time":"18:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Theatre","room":"Theatre","note":{},"location":" Charles B.

They should design an advanced analysis technique able to not just measure the signal strength but also to provide a confidence interval, from which correct coverage will be evaluated automatically from pseudo-experiments. The confidence interval should include statistical uncertainty and also systematic uncertainties (including, for example, detector calibration,background levels among others). It is expected that advanced analysis techniques that are able to control the impact of systematics will perform best, thereby pushing the field of uncertainty aware AI techniques for HEP and beyond. \r\n\r\nThe Codabench\/NERSC platform also allows for hosting challenges from other communities, and we also intend to make our benchmark designs available as templates so similar efforts can be easily launched in other domains.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2817859,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4919907,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796588\/attachments\/2817859\/4919907\/Fair%20Universe%202024%20-%20ACAT-Mar.pdf","title":"Fair Universe 2024 - ACAT-Mar.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-12T11:35:54.516470+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"Fair Universe 2024 - ACAT-Mar.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":4544446,"checksum":"65db170b3ae127d2b426c13b7b4e434e"},{"_type":"attachment","id":4919905,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796588\/attachments\/2817859\/4919905\/go","title":"Google slides","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-12T11:34:55.133045+00:00","type":"link","is_protected":false,"link_url":"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/1Apmkss9p6WOyvictexEf38aSDw46-Cc-a-guXnEJsSI"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796588\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Wahid","last_name":"Bhimji","fullName":"Bhimji, Wahid","id":"8426009","affiliation":"","emailHash":"c10a6d34259203289a293ea4515d29c4","db_id":8426009,"person_id":8105199}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Aishik","last_name":"Ghosh","fullName":"Ghosh, Aishik","id":"8426023","affiliation":"University of California Irvine (US)","emailHash":"7910744d6108dc3a182952d4f8db8635","db_id":8426023,"person_id":8105201},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Ben","last_name":"Nachman","fullName":"Nachman, Ben","id":"8426016","affiliation":"Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

After this development, we implemented the model onto DCU cluster. However, the performance was only 1\/6 of Nvidia GPU A100. Profiling action was done to the training process and the low speed was caused by the atom operation during the training function. After tuning the code, the training time was reduced by half then the previous model. Apart from DCU, we also trained on HUAWEI NPU card.

The DIS data analysis is performed on an event-level by combining the input from theoretical and experimental nuclear physics into a single, composable workflow. The optimization itself (I.e. fitting the experimental data with theoretical predictions) is carried out by a machine \/ deep learning algorithm. The size of the acquired DIS data as well as the complexity of the workflow itself require that the analysis is performed across multiple GPUs on high performance computing systems, such as Polaris at Argonne National Laboratory. \r\n\r\n \r\nThis presentation discusses the novelties and challenges that came along with parallelizing this workflow.

In this evolving landscape, adaptability has emerged as a pivotal factor in accelerating scientific discoveries through efficient execution of workflows. To increase resource utilization, reduce makespan, and minimize costs, it is essential to enable adaptive and asynchronous execution of heterogeneous tasks within scientific workflows. Consequently, middleware capable of scheduling and executing heterogeneous workflows must incorporate support for adaptive and asynchronous execution. We conduct an investigation into the advantages, prerequisites, and characteristics of a novel workflow execution middleware. Our proposed middleware dynamically adjusts the allocated resources for various task types based on historical execution data and executes them asynchronously.

To complement the future performance increases of software running on central processing units (CPUs), explorations of coprocessor usage in data processing hold great potential and interest. Coprocessors are a class of computer processors that supplement CPUs, often improving the execution of certain functions due to architectural design choices. In this talk, I will introduce the approach of Services for Optimized Network Inference on Coprocessors (SONIC) and discuss the study of the deployment of this as-a-service approach in large-scale data processing.\r\n\r\nIn the studies, we take a data processing workflow of the CMS experiment and run the main workflow on CPUs, while offloading several machine learning (ML)inference tasks onto either remote or local coprocessors, specifically graphics processing units (GPUs). With experiments performed at Google Cloud, the Purdue Tier-2 computing center, and combinations of the two, we demonstrate the acceleration of these ML algorithms individually on coprocessors and the corresponding throughput improvement for the entire workflow. We will also show this approach can be easily generalized to different types of coprocessors and deployed on local CPUs without decreasing the throughput performance.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2819351,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4922861,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796655\/attachments\/2819351\/4922861\/acat_poster_2024.pdf","title":"acat_poster_2024.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-13T16:37:12.872798+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"acat_poster_2024.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":1560146,"checksum":"f96ffce84846f87dfc08f5513c2a1eff"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796655\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Yongbin","last_name":"Feng","fullName":"Feng, Yongbin","id":"8426354","affiliation":"Fermi National Accelerator Lab.

Analyses involving tens of billions of recorded and simulated events, multiple machine learning algorithms for different purposes, and an amount of 100 or more systematic variations are no longer uncommon. These conditions impose a complex data flow on an analysis workflow and render its steering and bookkeeping a serious challenge.\r\nFor this purpose, a toolkit for columnar HEP analysis, called *columnflow*, has been developed. It is written in Python, experiment agnostic in its core, and supports any flat file format, such as ROOT-based trees or Parquet files. Leveraging on the vast Python ecosystem, vectorization and convenient physics objects representation can be achieved through NumPy, awkward arrays and other libraries. Based upon the Luigi Analysis Workflow (*law*) package, *columnflow* provides full analysis automation over arbitrary, distributed computing resources. Despite the end-to-end nature, this approach allows for persistent, intermediate outputs for purposes of debugging, caching, and exchange with collaborators. Job submission to various batch systems, such as HTCondor, Slurm, or CMS-CRAB, is natively supported. Remote files can be seamlessly accessed via various protocols using either the Grid File Access Library (GFAL2) or the fsspec file system interface. In addition, a sandboxing mechanism can encapsulate the execuction of parts of a workflow into dedicated environments, supporting subshells, virtual environments, and containers.\r\nThis contribution introduces the key components of *columnflow* and highlights the benefits of a fully automated workflow for complex and large-scale HEP analyses, showcasing an implementation of the Analysis Grand Challenge.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2819046,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4922288,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796871\/attachments\/2819046\/4922288\/acat2024_rieger_columnflow.pdf","title":"acat2024_rieger_columnflow.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-13T13:07:21.237009+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"acat2024_rieger_columnflow.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":879464,"checksum":"8e66810ee01d8e3fc32ce1cc73887c6b"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796871\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Bogdan","last_name":"Wiederspan","fullName":"Wiederspan, Bogdan","id":"8507452","affiliation":"Hamburg University (DE)","emailHash":"d8b5f683186814f1e32272008339a478","db_id":8507452,"person_id":8157986}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Bogdan","last_name":"Wiederspan","fullName":"Wiederspan, Bogdan","id":"8507452","affiliation":"Hamburg University (DE)","emailHash":"d8b5f683186814f1e32272008339a478","db_id":8507452,"person_id":8157986},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Marcel","last_name":"Rieger","fullName":"Rieger, Marcel","id":"8426873","affiliation":"Hamburg University (DE)","emailHash":"2649d10aea72ee92f56468d4dc217b91","db_id":8426873,"person_id":8157985}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 2: Data Analysis - Algorithms and Tools","session":"Poster session with coffee break","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"125","db_id":5796649,"friendly_id":125,"title":"Porting and optimizing the performance of LArTPC Detector Simulations with C++ standard parallelism","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-14","time":"21:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-14","time":"21:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":30,"roomFullname":"","room":"","note":{},"location":"Charles B.

For better performance portability, various programming models are developed across those computing systems, including Kokkos, SYCL, OpenMP, and others. Among these programming models, the C++ standard parallelism (std::par) has gained considerable attention within the community. Its inclusion as a part of the C++ standard library underscores its significance and potential impact, and it is also supported on AMD and Intel GPU recently.\r\nAs part of the High Energy Physics Center for Computational Excellence (HEP-CCE) project, we investigate if and how std::par may be suitable for experimental HEP workflows with some representative use cases. One of such use cases is the Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) simulation which is essential for LArTPC detector design, validation and data analysis. Following our earlier work of using Kokkos, OpenMP, and SYCL to port LArTPC simulations module, we are going to present the following topics: 1). How std::par is currently supported on different architectures and compiler, and comparison with other programming models; 2). Lesson learned from optimizing kernels with std::par; 3). Advantages and disadvantages of using std::par in porting LArTPC simulation and other HEP programs.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2820181,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4924509,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796649\/attachments\/2820181\/4924509\/acat2024_stdpar_poster%20(1).pdf","title":"acat2024_stdpar_poster (1).pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-14T15:04:02.284248+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"acat2024_stdpar_poster (1).pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":1668007,"checksum":"7616efa373d3055cf1f85b0a44c350c5"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796649\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Tianle","last_name":"Wang","fullName":"Wang, Tianle","id":"8426313","affiliation":"Brookhaven National Lab","emailHash":"a40cafccc1c3d337c4acdee2fd85eb9c","db_id":8426313,"person_id":8096525}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Charles","last_name":"Leggett","fullName":"Leggett, Charles","id":"8426317","affiliation":"Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (US)","emailHash":"287eff907e8b88ac28442324d4258129","db_id":8426317,"person_id":8096524},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Meifeng","last_name":"Lin","fullName":"Lin, Meifeng","id":"8426315","affiliation":"","emailHash":"6ed65b84c3bbe01d123547c3d593ee4e","db_id":8426315,"person_id":7925984},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Mohammad","last_name":"Atif","fullName":"Atif, Mohammad","id":"8426316","affiliation":"Brookhaven National Laboratory","emailHash":"550d93a74264a3d44aa53d00ff895b65","db_id":8426316,"person_id":8096514},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Tianle","last_name":"Wang","fullName":"Wang, Tianle","id":"8426313","affiliation":"Brookhaven National Lab","emailHash":"a40cafccc1c3d337c4acdee2fd85eb9c","db_id":8426313,"person_id":8096525},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Zhihua","last_name":"Dong","fullName":"Dong, Zhihua","id":"8426314","affiliation":"","emailHash":"60d79278ccc51d7ca8e9582f286d3849","db_id":8426314,"person_id":8096518}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","session":"Poster session with coffee break","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"124","db_id":5796648,"friendly_id":124,"title":"A Microbenchmark Framework for Performance Evaluation of OpenMP Target Offloading","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-14","time":"21:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-14","time":"21:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":30,"roomFullname":"","room":"","note":{},"location":"Charles B.

The compilers supporting OpenMP's target offload model for heterogeneous architectures are currently undergoing rapid development. These developments influence performance of various physics applications in different ways. This framework can be employed to track the impact of compiler upgrades and compare their performance with the native programming models. We use the framework to benchmark performance of a few commonly used operations on leadership class supercomputers such as Perlmutter at National Energy Research Scientific Computing (NERSC) Center and Frontier at Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF). Such a framework will be useful for compiler developers to gain insights into the overall impact of many small changes, as well as for users to decide which compilers and versions are expected to yield best performance for their applications.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2820018,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4924207,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796648\/attachments\/2820018\/4924207\/openmp_benchmarks_acat2024.pdf","title":"openmp_benchmarks_acat2024.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-14T13:37:42.859571+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"openmp_benchmarks_acat2024.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":3467983,"checksum":"b2be8175a6dc21ddf4159d1cf4602f5d"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796648\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Mohammad","last_name":"Atif","fullName":"Atif, Mohammad","id":"8426309","affiliation":"Brookhaven National Laboratory","emailHash":"550d93a74264a3d44aa53d00ff895b65","db_id":8426309,"person_id":8096514}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Meifeng","last_name":"Lin","fullName":"Lin, Meifeng","id":"8426312","affiliation":"","emailHash":"6ed65b84c3bbe01d123547c3d593ee4e","db_id":8426312,"person_id":7925984},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Mohammad","last_name":"Atif","fullName":"Atif, Mohammad","id":"8426309","affiliation":"Brookhaven National Laboratory","emailHash":"550d93a74264a3d44aa53d00ff895b65","db_id":8426309,"person_id":8096514},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Tianle","last_name":"Wang","fullName":"Wang, Tianle","id":"8426311","affiliation":"Brookhaven National Lab","emailHash":"a40cafccc1c3d337c4acdee2fd85eb9c","db_id":8426311,"person_id":8096525},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Zhihua","last_name":"Dong","fullName":"Dong, Zhihua","id":"8426310","affiliation":"","emailHash":"60d79278ccc51d7ca8e9582f286d3849","db_id":8426310,"person_id":8096518}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","session":"Poster session with coffee break","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"122","db_id":5796865,"friendly_id":122,"title":"Easy columnar file conversions with \"odapt\"","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-14","time":"21:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-14","time":"21:40:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":30,"roomFullname":"","room":"","note":{},"location":"Charles B.

One of the most critical problems involve the logistics of wide-area with multi stage workflows that move back and forth across multiple resource providers. We envision a model where such a challenge can be addressed enabling a \"transparent offloading\u201d of containerized payloads  using the Kubernetes API primitives enabling a transparent access to any number of external hardware machines and type of backends. Thus we created the interLink project, an open source extension to the concept of Virtual-Kubelet with a design that aims for a common abstraction over heterogeneous and distributed backends. The primary goal is to have HPC centers exploitable with native Kubernetes APIs with an effort close to zero from  all the stakeholders' standpoint. \r\ninterLink is developed by INFN in the context of interTwin, an EU funded project that aims to build a digital-twin platform ( Digital Twin Engine)  for sciences, and the ICSC National Research Centre for High Performance Computing, Big Data and Quantum Computing in Italy. In this talk we will walk through the key features and the early use cases of a Kubernetes-based computing platform capable of extending its computational capabilities over heterogeneous providers: among others, the integration of a world-class supercomputer such as EuroHPC Vega will be showcased.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2818411,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4920963,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796647\/attachments\/2818411\/4920963\/Poster%20inteLink%20ACAT2024%20(2).pdf","title":"Poster inteLink ACAT2024 (2).pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-12T16:41:28.183973+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"Poster inteLink ACAT2024 (2).pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":4168651,"checksum":"c39bd4b48d008b49e562442170b13095"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796647\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Tommaso","last_name":"Tedeschi","fullName":"Tedeschi, Tommaso","id":"8426305","affiliation":"Universita e INFN, Perugia (IT)","emailHash":"72ef0b290e1264964ac4f2a2c2409c04","db_id":8426305,"person_id":8114082}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Daniele","last_name":"Spiga","fullName":"Spiga, Daniele","id":"8426304","affiliation":"Universita e INFN, Perugia (IT)","emailHash":"7b97af96ccc24f7684d7b1be0f2f605c","db_id":8426304,"person_id":8165491},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Diego","last_name":"Ciangottini","fullName":"Ciangottini, Diego","id":"8426303","affiliation":"INFN, Perugia (IT)","emailHash":"bc7330245b15761981349f5fa0fed77c","db_id":8426303,"person_id":8165493}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Ahmed Shiraz","last_name":"Memon","fullName":"Memon, Ahmed Shiraz","id":"8426301","affiliation":"","emailHash":"f6313da4d902d51eaf09d9d97f388024","db_id":8426301,"person_id":8165492},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Andrea","last_name":"Manzi","fullName":"Manzi, Andrea","id":"8426307","affiliation":"","emailHash":"3d9c557729a9d4f9000b7e5e7eab0619","db_id":8426307,"person_id":8165490},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Andrej","last_name":"Filipcic","fullName":"Filipcic, Andrej","id":"8426302","affiliation":"Jozef Stefan Institute (SI)","emailHash":"2bfc3dcae6061d54150b9904432bf7ee","db_id":8426302,"person_id":8165494},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Teo","last_name":"Prica","fullName":"Prica, Teo","id":"8426300","affiliation":"IZUM","emailHash":"b1b208cc6c5c437f4fd3a13a91e76307","db_id":8426300,"person_id":8165495},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Tommaso","last_name":"Boccali","fullName":"Boccali, Tommaso","id":"8426308","affiliation":"INFN Sezione di Pisa","emailHash":"ad27265638303547200b971ea77f7b31","db_id":8426308,"person_id":8105049},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Tommaso","last_name":"Tedeschi","fullName":"Tedeschi, Tommaso","id":"8426305","affiliation":"Universita e INFN, Perugia (IT)","emailHash":"72ef0b290e1264964ac4f2a2c2409c04","db_id":8426305,"person_id":8114082},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"giacomo","last_name":"surace","fullName":"surace, giacomo","id":"8426306","affiliation":"infn","emailHash":"99d6a30032ac1c912e1567fa25f07ac9","db_id":8426306,"person_id":8165489}],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","session":"Poster session with coffee break","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"114","db_id":5796646,"friendly_id":114,"title":"RTDP: Streaming Readout Real-Time Development and Testing Platform","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-13","time":"21:15:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-13","time":"21:45:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":30,"roomFullname":"","room":"","note":{},"location":"Charles B.

The Hydra system is backed by a database which is leveraged for near push button training and is primarily controlled and viewed through a set of web interfaces. This web interface contains a simple-to-use web based GUI for labeling of the datasets used in training; making it possible to label thousands of images quickly and efficiently.

Traditional algorithms exhibit high computational complexity in this domain as the number of particles increases. This poster addresses the challenges of training GNN models on large, rapidly evolving datasets, a common scenario given the advancements in data generation, collection, and increase in storage capabilities. The computational and GPU memory requirements present significant roadblocks in efficiently training GNNs on large graph structures. One effective strategy to reduce training time is distributed data parallelism on multi-GPUs, which involves averaging gradients across the devices used for training.\r\nThis poster will report the speed-up of GNN training time when using distributed data parallelism with different numbers of GPUs and computing nodes. Running GNN training with distributed data parallelism leads to a decrease in accuracy. We are investigating the relationship between the number of devices and model accuracy degradation and strategies to mitigate it. Preliminary results on the TrackML dataset will be reported. GPU nodes from Perlmutter at NERSC will be used to run the experiments.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2819432,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4923049,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796858\/attachments\/2819432\/4923049\/ACAT24Poster_last.pdf","title":"ACAT24Poster_last.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-13T19:40:36.050004+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"ACAT24Poster_last.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":1999128,"checksum":"becc01106e23ce84ad9491d1835bb04e"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796858\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alina","last_name":"Lazar","fullName":"Lazar, Alina","id":"8426827","affiliation":"Youngstown State University","emailHash":"5db364c0260c00c0eaa6a66141ac7b5f","db_id":8426827,"person_id":8165204}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Ivan","last_name":"Laduska","fullName":"Laduska, Ivan","id":"8426820","affiliation":"Youngstown State University","emailHash":"c9d0fd4d2333130222e58bdc6407d1d3","db_id":8426820,"person_id":8165208},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Brenden","last_name":"Reeves","fullName":"Reeves, Brenden","id":"8426825","affiliation":"Youngstown State University","emailHash":"bb3c3c5c3500829788bc8be760b996ff","db_id":8426825,"person_id":8165203},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Caroline","last_name":"Manjerovic","fullName":"Manjerovic, Caroline","id":"8426824","affiliation":"Youngstown State University","emailHash":"42d4e1117ce27299cb9f17f05437751c","db_id":8426824,"person_id":8165206},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alina","last_name":"Lazar","fullName":"Lazar, Alina","id":"8426827","affiliation":"Youngstown State University","emailHash":"5db364c0260c00c0eaa6a66141ac7b5f","db_id":8426827,"person_id":8165204},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Minh-Tuan","last_name":"Pham","fullName":"Pham, Minh-Tuan","id":"8426822","affiliation":"University of Wisconsin Madison (US)","emailHash":"afd5ec0497bd60b3befcbe88c27dc0a7","db_id":8426822,"person_id":8165207},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jay","last_name":"Chan","fullName":"Chan, Jay","id":"8426821","affiliation":"Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Wang Center, Stony Brook University","type":"Poster","description":"The Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva is poised for a transformative upgrade, preparing to enhance both its accelerator and particle detectors. This strategic initiative is driven by the tenfold increase in proton-proton collisions anticipated for the forthcoming high-luminosity phase scheduled to start by 2029. The vital role played by the underlying computational infrastructure, the World-Wide LHC Computing Grid, in processing the data generated during these collisions underlines the need for its expansion and adaptation to meet the demands of the new accelerator phase. The provision of these computational resources by the worldwide community remains essential, all within a constant budgetary framework. While technological advancements offer some relief for the expected increase, numerous research and development projects are underway. Their aim is to bring future resources to manageable levels and provide cost-effective solutions to effectively handle the expanding volume of generated data. In the quest for optimised data access and resource utilisation, the LHC community is actively investigating Content Delivery Network (CDN) techniques. These techniques serve as a mechanism for the cost-effective deployment of lightweight storage systems that support both, traditional and opportunistic compute resources. Furthermore, they aim to enhance the performance of executing tasks by facilitating the efficient reading of input data via caching content near the end user. A comprehensive study is presented to assess the benefits of implementing data cache solutions for the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment. This in-depth examination serves as a use-case study specifically conducted for the Spanish compute facilities, playing a crucial role in supporting CMS activities. Data access patterns and popularity studies suggest that user analysis tasks benefit the most from CDN techniques. Consequently, a data cache has been introduced in the region to acquire a deeper understanding of these effects. In this contribution we will focus on the remote data accesses from users that execute tasks in the Spanish CMS sites, in order to simulate and discern the most optimal requirements in both size and network connectivity for a data cache serving the whole Spanish region. This is a mandatory step towards a better understanding of the service to be deployed in a federated fashion in the region.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2818367,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4920881,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796642\/attachments\/2818367\/4920881\/20240311_ACAT_XCache_Poster.pdf","title":"20240311_ACAT_XCache_Poster.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-12T15:54:59.752577+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"20240311_ACAT_XCache_Poster.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":1058451,"checksum":"0544a9e37b6efd16909a2791a589b908"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796642\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jose","last_name":"Flix Molina","fullName":"Flix Molina, Jose","id":"8426275","affiliation":"CIEMAT - Centro de Investigaciones  Energ\u00e9ticas Medioambientales y Tec.

With its homogeneous Grid centers all around the world trimmed to a high throughput of data, it is tailored to support typical HEP workflows, offering an optimal environment for efficient job execution.                                        \r\n                                                                                                    \r\nWith the future German HEP computing strategy, however, there will be a shift away from dedicated resources to official shares on national HPC centers.\r\nThis bears many challenges, since these more heterogeneous resources are designed for performance and security rather than transfering and processing large amounts of data. The different focus and certain limitations can lead to higher failure rates and worse efficiency of HEP jobs running at such centers, i.e. because of tendentially slower WAN connections.\r\nMonitoring data collected at the HoreKa HPC Center at KIT further confirmed that assumption. Lower CPU efficiency and an increased failure rate compared to the KIT Tier-1 center indicated a bandwidth limitation, in particular for data intensive workflows.\r\n\r\nAn efficient resource utilization, however, is the main objective for the success of the German HEP strategy in the future, not only in terms of sustainability, but also to cope with the anticipated data rates of the HL-LHC era. To tackle these challenges, we developed an XRootD\/XCache based solution - in close contact with the XRootD\/XCache developers - that aims to maximize computational throughput and mitigates the limitations of contemporary HPC centers. The currently operational setup at HoreKa leverages the parallel filesystem and a transfer node of the cluster as some sort of XRootD caching 'buffer', leading to a more stable performance and better utilization of the cluster.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, the prerequisites and challenges associated with HEP workflows on HPC centers are pointed out and our solution for a more efficient utilization, backed by a fully operational proof of concept on HoreKa, is presented.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2818325,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4920793,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796641\/attachments\/2818325\/4920793\/RHofsaess_ACAT2024.pdf","title":"RHofsaess_ACAT2024.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-12T15:13:49.620701+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"RHofsaess_ACAT2024.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":2309847,"checksum":"0dfad09488c92e6689782899098d30aa"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796641\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Robin","last_name":"Hofsaess","fullName":"Hofsaess, Robin","id":"8426272","affiliation":"KIT - Karlsruhe Institute of  Technology (DE)","emailHash":"db497bbc6ff8f75a7469c0d9c58041ec","db_id":8426272,"person_id":8161861}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Robin","last_name":"Hofsaess","fullName":"Hofsaess, Robin","id":"8426272","affiliation":"KIT - Karlsruhe Institute of  Technology (DE)","emailHash":"db497bbc6ff8f75a7469c0d9c58041ec","db_id":8426272,"person_id":8161861}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Achim","last_name":"Streit","fullName":"Streit, Achim","id":"8426273","affiliation":"KIT - Karlsruhe Institute of  Technology (DE)","emailHash":"262687ebcd2c33b5380e2b0cf5203c5c","db_id":8426273,"person_id":8162614},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Andreas","last_name":"Petzold","fullName":"Petzold, Andreas","id":"8426270","affiliation":"KIT - Karlsruhe Institute of  Technology (DE)","emailHash":"aaedaf0b6923da9472cbc33726464d1d","db_id":8426270,"person_id":8162613},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Artur Il Darovic","last_name":"Gottmann","fullName":"Gottmann, Artur Il Darovic","id":"8426274","affiliation":"KIT - Karlsruhe Institute of  Technology (DE)","emailHash":"52b28523f0eb8d225f0d51d7c855e100","db_id":8426274,"person_id":8161860},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Gunter","last_name":"Quast","fullName":"Quast, Gunter","id":"8426271","affiliation":"KIT - Karlsruhe Institute of  Technology (DE)","emailHash":"7aba38cfa2a99bc621b6076d46ea0ab9","db_id":8426271,"person_id":8161863},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Manuel","last_name":"Giffels","fullName":"Giffels, Manuel","id":"8426269","affiliation":"KIT - Karlsruhe Institute of  Technology (DE)","emailHash":"4535f96fcde7dd5d7c121710acfa24cd","db_id":8426269,"person_id":8161864},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Matthias Jochen","last_name":"Schnepf","fullName":"Schnepf, Matthias Jochen","id":"8426268","affiliation":"","emailHash":"4af3151f7ba0d19eeba9bbec003feea3","db_id":8426268,"person_id":8161862}],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","session":"Poster session with coffee break","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"105","db_id":5796638,"friendly_id":105,"title":"Optimizing Resource Provisioning Across Diverse Computing Facilities with Virtual Kubelet Integration","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-13","time":"21:15:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-13","time":"21:45:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":30,"roomFullname":"","room":"","note":{},"location":"Charles B.

At the LHC's ALTAS experiment, beam induced background (BIB) and QCD jets are the two significant sources of background. For this purpose, a recurrent neural network (RNN) with an adversary was used to distinguish long lived particles from BIB and QCD as well as control systematic errors. We are presenting the modernization of this neural network through the use of software tools and techniques including testing, continuous integration, and current software design techniques. This modernization has improved the sustainability, functionality, versatility, and performance of the network which will be used in future analyses.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2818142,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4920470,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5807078\/attachments\/2818142\/4920470\/ACAT%20Poster%20Final.pdf","title":"ACAT Poster Final.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-12T13:41:00.082022+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"ACAT Poster Final.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":2573558,"checksum":"f50d59bc75cbcf7f297afc8c7a6a2d57"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5807078\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alexandra","last_name":"Golub","fullName":"Golub, Alexandra","id":"8445018","affiliation":"University of Washington (US)","emailHash":"c0a65777f1b1c859d31a8ceedc7631fd","db_id":8445018,"person_id":8159135}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alexandra","last_name":"Golub","fullName":"Golub, Alexandra","id":"8445018","affiliation":"University of Washington (US)","emailHash":"c0a65777f1b1c859d31a8ceedc7631fd","db_id":8445018,"person_id":8159135},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Gordon","last_name":"Watts","fullName":"Watts, Gordon","id":"8445017","affiliation":"University of Washington (US)","emailHash":"53faef883b37fb4dc03d02269b5a4401","db_id":8445017,"person_id":8105319}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 2: Data Analysis - Algorithms and Tools","session":"Poster session with coffee break","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"98","db_id":5796635,"friendly_id":98,"title":"Lamarr: implementing a flash-simulation paradigm at LHCb","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-13","time":"21:15:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-13","time":"21:45:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":30,"roomFullname":"","room":"","note":{},"location":"Charles B.

The detector and trigger upgrades introduced for Run3 allow to collect larger datasets that, in turn, will require larger simulated samples. Despite the use of a variety of fast simulation options, the demands for simulations will far exceed the pledged resources. \r\nTo face upcoming and future requests for simulated samples, we propose Lamarr, a novel framework implementing a flash-simulation paradigm via parametric functions and deep generative models.\r\nIntegrated within the general LHCb Simulation software framework, Lamarr provides analysis-level variables taking as input particles from physics generators, and parameterizing the detector response and the reconstruction algorithms. Lamarr consists of a pipeline of machine-learning-based modules that allow, for selected sets of particles, to introduce reconstruction errors or infer high-level quantities via (non-)parametric functions.\r\nGood agreement is observed by comparing key reconstructed quantities obtained with Lamarr against those from the existing detailed Geant4-based simulation. A reduction of at least two orders of magnitude in the computational cost for the detector modeling phase of the LHCb simulation is expected when adopting Lamarr.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2816439,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4916972,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796635\/attachments\/2816439\/4916972\/go","title":"Lamarr poster -

These reports are a valuable source of information, but they are also difficult to access and query. In this work, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer questions based on the Snowmass corpus. RAG is a technique that combines LLMs with document retrieval, allowing the model to select relevant passages from the corpus and generate answers. We describe how we indexed the Snowmass reports for RAG, how we compared different LLMs for this task, and how we evaluated the quality and usefulness of the answers. We discuss the potential applications and limitations of this approach for particle physics and beyond.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2817415,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4918988,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796631\/attachments\/2817415\/4918988\/RAG%20-%20Poster.pdf","title":"RAG - Poster.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-11T21:33:26.187198+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"RAG - Poster.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":889860,"checksum":"4f08a48b32b7dee1c7a2297c102141bd"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796631\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Gordon","last_name":"Watts","fullName":"Watts, Gordon","id":"8426238","affiliation":"University of Washington (US)","emailHash":"53faef883b37fb4dc03d02269b5a4401","db_id":8426238,"person_id":8105319}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Benjamin","last_name":"Galewsky","fullName":"Galewsky, Benjamin","id":"8426239","affiliation":"Univ.

Wang Center, Stony Brook University","type":"Poster","description":"The increasing computing power and bandwidth of programmable digital devices opens new possibilities in the field of real-time processing of HEP data. LHCb is exploiting this technology advancements in various ways to enhance its capability for complex data reconstruction in real time. Amongst them is the real-time reconstruction of hits in the VELO pixel detector, by means of cluster-finding \"on-the-fly\" embedded in the readout board firmware. This reconstruction, in addition to savings of DAQ bandwidth and HLT computing resources, also enables further useful applications in precision monitoring and diagnostics of LHC beam conditions. In fact, clusters of pixels, while being more reliable and robust indications of physical particle hits than raw pixel counts, are exempt from the complications associated to the reconstruction of tracks, that involve alignment issues and are sensitive to multi-layer efficiency products. In this talk, we describe the design and implementation of a flexible system embedded in the readout firmware of the VELO detector, allowing real-time counting of cluster density in many parts of the detector simultaneously, and separately for every bunch ID, for every single LHC collision, without any slowdown of data acquisition. Quantitative applications of this system to luminosity measurement and beam monitoring are demonstrated.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2817861,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4919940,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796599\/attachments\/2817861\/4919940\/LHCb_bgi_video_balagura.gif","title":"LHCb_bgi_video_balagura.gif","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-12T11:39:52.176796+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"LHCb_bgi_video_balagura.gif","content_type":"image\/gif","size":5211217,"checksum":"9d48ed400d673820ce9f27424e75a8ce"},{"_type":"attachment","id":4919914,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796599\/attachments\/2817861\/4919914\/LHC-beam-monitoring-Retina-PASSARO-archE.pdf","title":"LHC-beam-monitoring-Retina-PASSARO-archE.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-12T11:37:50.711661+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"LHC-beam-monitoring-Retina-PASSARO-archE.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":1549839,"checksum":"8d4edf86ed69d6c949623444f2115b29"},{"_type":"attachment","id":4919993,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796599\/attachments\/2817861\/4919993\/go","title":"Retina tracking (ACAT presentation)","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-12T11:52:16.606353+00:00","type":"link","is_protected":false,"link_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796610\/"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796599\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Daniele","last_name":"Passaro","fullName":"Passaro, Daniele","id":"8426078","affiliation":"SNS & INFN Pisa (IT)","emailHash":"a34707dd82c0b8284c486676ed408587","db_id":8426078,"person_id":8105155}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Daniele","last_name":"Passaro","fullName":"Passaro, Daniele","id":"8426078","affiliation":"SNS & INFN Pisa (IT)","emailHash":"a34707dd82c0b8284c486676ed408587","db_id":8426078,"person_id":8105155},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Federico","last_name":"Lazzari","fullName":"Lazzari, Federico","id":"8426079","affiliation":"Universita di Pisa & INFN Pisa (IT)","emailHash":"407af292b8278f432cc8ff42efee27ec","db_id":8426079,"person_id":8105158},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Giovanni","last_name":"Punzi","fullName":"Punzi, Giovanni","id":"8426077","affiliation":"Universita & INFN Pisa (IT)","emailHash":"8e9c8039ef6f2cfaab3e0c01ad96d485","db_id":8426077,"person_id":8105154},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Giulio","last_name":"Cordova","fullName":"Cordova, Giulio","id":"8426080","affiliation":"Universita & INFN Pisa (IT)","emailHash":"74f7e0a237154a8e9f9838eaab1d8971","db_id":8426080,"person_id":8105152},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Giovanni","last_name":"Bassi","fullName":"Bassi, Giovanni","id":"8426075","affiliation":"SNS & INFN Pisa (IT)","emailHash":"47013f62479e027171e7145e940fc6b6","db_id":8426075,"person_id":8105153},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Michael J.","last_name":"Morello","fullName":"Morello, Michael J.","id":"8426076","affiliation":"SNS and INFN-Pisa (IT)","emailHash":"5807ffd1efe5a1f54da221c0d41224b4","db_id":8426076,"person_id":8105156},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Elena","last_name":"Graverini","fullName":"Graverini, Elena","id":"8426081","affiliation":"EPFL - Ecole Polytechnique Federale Lausanne (CH)","emailHash":"f2fa6f8f8ed2ddf7a441e9c99a14da6d","db_id":8426081,"person_id":8105157}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","session":"Poster session with coffee break","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"71","db_id":5796598,"friendly_id":71,"title":"Declarative paradigms for analysis description and implementation","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-13","time":"21:15:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-13","time":"21:45:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":30,"roomFullname":"","room":"","note":{},"location":"Charles B.

The data analysis in High Energy Physics at CERN in particular will require, ahead of the next phase of high-luminosity at LHC, access to big amounts of data (order of 100 PB\/year). However, thanks to continuous developments on resource handling and software, it is possible to offer users a more flexible and dynamic data access as well as access to open-source industry standards like Jupyter, Dask and HTCondor. This paves the way for innovative approaches: from a batch-based approach to an interactive high throughput platform, based on a parallel and geographically distributed back-end and leveraging the \u201cHigh-Performance Computing, Big Data e Quantum Computing Research Centre\u201d Italian National Center (ICSC) DataLake model.\r\nThis contribution will report the effort of porting multiple data analysis applications - from different collaborations and covering a wide range of physics processes - from a legacy approach to an interactive approach based on declarative solutions, like ROOT RDataFrame. These applications are then executed on the above-mentioned cloud infrastructure, splitting the workflow on multiple worker nodes and outputting the results on a single interface. A performance evaluation, therefore, will also be provided: tentative metrics will be identified, with speed-up benchmarks by upscaling to distributed resources. This will allow to find bottlenecks and\/or drawbacks of the proposed high-throughput interactive approach, and eventually help developers committed to its deployment in the Italian National Center.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2816238,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4916465,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796597\/attachments\/2816238\/4916465\/ACAT2024_Quasi%20interactive%20analysis%20of%20High%20Energy%20Physics%20big%20data%20with%20high%20throughput.pdf","title":"ACAT2024_Quasi

A particularly challenging aspect of this endeavor is preservation of complex physics analyses, selected for their scientific importance and the value of the specific techniques developed as a part of the research. For this, we have chosen one of the most impactful PHENIX results, the joint study of direct photons and neutral pions in high-energy d+Au collisions. To ensure reproducibility of this analysis going forward, we partitioned it into self-contained tasks and used a combination of containerization techniques, code management, and robust documentation. We then leveraged REANA (the platform for reproducible analysis developed at CERN) to run the required software. We present our experience based on this example, and outline our future plans for analysis preservation.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2816485,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4917058,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796596\/attachments\/2816485\/4917058\/ACAT24_PHENIX_DAP_v1.pdf","title":"PHENIX Analysis Preservation","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-10T22:40:22.632591+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"ACAT24_PHENIX_DAP_v1.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":593344,"checksum":"bde30a278084caea854de8377656350c"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796596\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Gabor","last_name":"David","fullName":"David, Gabor","id":"8426068","affiliation":"Stony Brook University","emailHash":"e11439794c76dd397c7fd9c7005e4449","db_id":8426068,"person_id":8104976},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Maxim","last_name":"Potekhin","fullName":"Potekhin, Maxim","id":"8426066","affiliation":"Brookhaven National Laboratory (US)","emailHash":"ae4376aedbf0e52c2f9c833172e30352","db_id":8426066,"person_id":8104975}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Dmitri","last_name":"Smirnov","fullName":"Smirnov, Dmitri","id":"8426067","affiliation":"BNL","emailHash":"53375ff9f1ac2115e53debd7f5575897","db_id":8426067,"person_id":8104974},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Gabor","last_name":"David","fullName":"David, Gabor","id":"8426068","affiliation":"Stony Brook University","emailHash":"e11439794c76dd397c7fd9c7005e4449","db_id":8426068,"person_id":8104976},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Maxim","last_name":"Potekhin","fullName":"Potekhin, Maxim","id":"8426066","affiliation":"Brookhaven National Laboratory (US)","emailHash":"ae4376aedbf0e52c2f9c833172e30352","db_id":8426066,"person_id":8104975}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","session":"Poster session with coffee break","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"67","db_id":5796595,"friendly_id":67,"title":"AdaptivePerf: a portable, low-overhead, and comprehensive code profiler for single- and multi-threaded applications","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-13","time":"21:15:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-13","time":"21:45:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":30,"roomFullname":"","room":"","note":{},"location":"Charles B. Wang Center, Stony Brook University","type":"Poster","description":"Considering the slowdown of Moore\u2019s Law, an increasing need for energy efficiency, and larger and larger amounts of data to be processed in real-time and non-real-time in physics research, new computing paradigms are emerging in hardware and software. This requires bigger awareness from developers and researchers to squeeze as much performance as possible out of applications. However, this is a difficult task in case of complex and large codebases, where pinpointing a specific bottleneck is hard without profiling. At the same time, finding a suitable low-overhead and extensive profiler which works for a wide range of homogeneous and heterogeneous architectures proves to be challenging, especially when multi-threaded application support, user-friendliness, and reliability are important.\r\n\r\nTo address this, we introduce AdaptivePerf, developed in the context of the SYCLOPS EU project: an open-source comprehensive profiling tool based on sampling and system call tracing through patched Linux perf. It improves shortcomings sometimes observed in Linux perf such as broken stacks, no off-CPU data, and reports unclear to developers. The tool also further builds on its functionality by profiling how threads and processes are spawned within a program and what code parts are most time-consuming on- and off-CPU for each thread\/process. Additionally, AdaptivePerf presents results in a user-friendly way by showing an interactive timeline with stack traces of functions starting new threads\/processes and the browser of per-thread\/per-process non-time-ordered flame graphs and time-ordered flame charts.\r\n\r\nAdaptivePerf is designed with architecture portability in mind: the main features are based on hardware-independent metrics like wall time, while hardware-specific extensions such as profiling non-CPU devices (GPUs, FPGAs etc.) or capturing CPU-dependent perf events are possible. Thanks to our tool, detecting bottlenecks and addressing them within software and\/or hardware is significantly easier for developers and researchers.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we will discuss the status of the profiler and its future prospects.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2817138,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4918397,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796595\/attachments\/2817138\/4918397\/AdaptivePerf%20ACAT%20poster.pdf","title":"AdaptivePerf ACAT poster.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-11T14:04:15.685015+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"AdaptivePerf ACAT poster.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":762512,"checksum":"f484165b4c942c1b577c5ccd41bdf4be"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796595\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Maksymilian","last_name":"Graczyk","fullName":"Graczyk, Maksymilian","id":"8426064","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"209627b6dc6ab06ef8343c0a09e51841","db_id":8426064,"person_id":8104965}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Maksymilian","last_name":"Graczyk","fullName":"Graczyk, Maksymilian","id":"8426064","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"209627b6dc6ab06ef8343c0a09e51841","db_id":8426064,"person_id":8104965}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Stefan","last_name":"Roiser","fullName":"Roiser, Stefan","id":"8426065","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"e0c62f86305aa41c91d857b662068a19","db_id":8426065,"person_id":8104964}],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","session":"Poster session with coffee break","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"66","db_id":5796594,"friendly_id":66,"title":"Generative Modeling for Fast Shower Simulation","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"21:15:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"21:45:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":30,"roomFullname":"","room":"","note":{},"location":"Charles B.

Using a three-dimensional, cylindrical scoring mesh, a shower event is parameterized by the total energy deposited on each cell of the scoring mesh. Due to the three-dimensional geometry, to simulate a shower event, it is required to learn a complex probability distribution of $O(10^3) \\sim O(10^4)$ dimensional random variable. It should be noted that, on top of the high dimensionality, the sparse nature of a shower event, where energy is randomly deposited only on less than than 20\\% of the cells, and the intermittency, which requires to capture large magnitudes but low probability events, make the development of a fast shower simulator challenging. To overcome these challenges, we develop a deep-learning framework, which can facilitate a model development by combining different neural network architectures with a range of generative models, e.g., variational auto-encoder, generative adversarial network, Wasserstein generative adversarial network, and denoising diffusion probabilistic model. In this study, we compare various generative models for the shower simulation. Also, the effects of the data scaling and regularizations are discussed. A distributed computing strategy for the deep generative model is discussed to develop a foundation model for the fast shower simulation.","folders":[],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796594\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Kyongmin","last_name":"Yeo","fullName":"Yeo, Kyongmin","id":"8426063","affiliation":"IBM Research","emailHash":"1d33c493f55f6ac14a3d767df6ce4163","db_id":8426063,"person_id":8104809}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Kyongmin","last_name":"Yeo","fullName":"Yeo, Kyongmin","id":"8426063","affiliation":"IBM Research","emailHash":"1d33c493f55f6ac14a3d767df6ce4163","db_id":8426063,"person_id":8104809},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Vijay","last_name":"Ekambaram","fullName":"Ekambaram, Vijay","id":"8426054","affiliation":"IBM Research","emailHash":null,"db_id":8426054,"person_id":8104918},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Nam","last_name":"Nguyen","fullName":"Nguyen, Nam","id":"8426062","affiliation":"IBM Research","emailHash":null,"db_id":8426062,"person_id":8104920},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Piyush","last_name":"Raikwar","fullName":"Raikwar, Piyush","id":"8426058","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"51834ded552abd49a3e367f9c6e4e260","db_id":8426058,"person_id":8104811},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Renato Paulo","last_name":"Da Costa Cardoso","fullName":"Da Costa Cardoso, Renato Paulo","id":"8426057","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"60ac46a9137b66e0d670ec62287829d5","db_id":8426057,"person_id":8104813},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Anna","last_name":"Zaborowska","fullName":"Zaborowska, Anna","id":"8426055","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"dcaef00a363c06a59e930cb84c26d56f","db_id":8426055,"person_id":8104805},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Dalila","last_name":"Salamani","fullName":"Salamani, Dalila","id":"8426060","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"1582e674296ffeef525ea4cb2e136fb6","db_id":8426060,"person_id":8104806},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Kristina","last_name":"Jaruskova","fullName":"Jaruskova, Kristina","id":"8426061","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"768a81847f714252fac2a89b7bf806b4","db_id":8426061,"person_id":8104808},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sofia","last_name":"Vallecorsa","fullName":"Vallecorsa, Sofia","id":"8426056","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"42eeb1ebb171454cf2f5b652c7168a8c","db_id":8426056,"person_id":8096284},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jayant","last_name":"Kalagnanam","fullName":"Kalagnanam, Jayant","id":"8426059","affiliation":"IBM Research","emailHash":null,"db_id":8426059,"person_id":8104919}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","session":"Poster session with coffee break","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"61","db_id":5796589,"friendly_id":61,"title":"Enabling Computing Resources to Support Grid Jobs and Cluster Jobs Simultaneously","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"21:15:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"21:45:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":30,"roomFullname":"","room":"","note":{},"location":"Charles B.

This project will use the idea of \"workflow\" to independently design and implement a set of graphical general-purpose management systems to solve the following key problems: how to quickly share and apply data processing methods to experiments by beam-line scientists, experiment users, and methodology developers during analysis; how researchers can flexibly customize and monitor complex and diverse data processing processes; how the whole process of experimental analysis can be applied in batches to similar experiments and the results can be reproduced. Two typical photon source experiments, the acquisition of the pair distribution function (PDF) of diffraction scatterings and the structural analysis of biological macro-molecules, will be used as application examples to show us how the workflow management system facilitates scientific research.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2817447,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4919043,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796844\/attachments\/2817447\/4919043\/Poster_ACAT2024_sunhk.pdf","title":"Poster_ACAT2024_sunhk.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-12T01:00:47.573931+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"Poster_ACAT2024_sunhk.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":1490761,"checksum":"e54eae82e55e781570f8ab52607be68c"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796844\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"lei","last_name":"wang","fullName":"wang, lei","id":"8426763","affiliation":"Institute of High Energy Physics","emailHash":"1d61988cc8f20a80b0ad59718977f31c","db_id":8426763,"person_id":8103389}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Hao-Kai","last_name":"Sun","fullName":"Sun, Hao-Kai","id":"8426765","affiliation":"IHEP, CAS","emailHash":"6386dfaefc2a2e75fb9b1ae2db8f8588","db_id":8426765,"person_id":8103395},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Yu","last_name":"Hu","fullName":"Hu, Yu","id":"8426764","affiliation":"","emailHash":"1e3533bdafbdb3e4b71157caeb4cb7de","db_id":8426764,"person_id":8070575}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"FU Shiyuan","last_name":"fusy","fullName":"fusy, FU Shiyuan","id":"8426766","affiliation":"","emailHash":"80da714a95d7c08e7a56734aac46b067","db_id":8426766,"person_id":8103388},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jianli","last_name":"Liu","fullName":"Liu, Jianli","id":"8426769","affiliation":"Institute of High Energy Physics","emailHash":"9572dbe8439c01c5854eb281b9c03d68","db_id":8426769,"person_id":8103396},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Qi","last_name":"Fazhi","fullName":"Fazhi, Qi","id":"8426767","affiliation":"IHEP","emailHash":"c23c808c40dd4dd23cb23df39d9a3c70","db_id":8426767,"person_id":8103394},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Rui","last_name":"Liu","fullName":"Liu, Rui","id":"8426768","affiliation":"Institute of High Energy Physics","emailHash":"cad4f226f16889e101248fc198570e4f","db_id":8426768,"person_id":8103391},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"lei","last_name":"wang","fullName":"wang, lei","id":"8426763","affiliation":"Institute of High Energy Physics","emailHash":"1d61988cc8f20a80b0ad59718977f31c","db_id":8426763,"person_id":8103389}],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 2: Data Analysis - Algorithms and Tools","session":"Poster session with coffee break","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"53","db_id":5796583,"friendly_id":53,"title":"Deployment of ATLAS Calorimeter Fast Simulation Training Through Container Technology","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"21:15:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"21:45:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":30,"roomFullname":"","room":"","note":{},"location":"Charles B.

Among simulation tasks, calorimeter simulation is the most demanding, taking up about 80% of resource use for simulation and expected to increase in the future. Solutions have been developed to cope with this demand, notably fast simulation tools based on Machine Learning (ML) techniques, which are faster than Geant4 when simulating calorimeter response and maintain a high level of accuracy. However, these ML-based models require a lot of computing resources to train.\r\nMoreover, computational resources can also be saved by deploying their training on other resources than the CERN HTCondor batch system or the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid, with the opportunity to have an additional boost in computing performance.\r\nIn this work we introduce FastCaloGANtainer, a containerized version of FastCaloGAN, a fast simulation tool developed by the ATLAS Collaboration. FastCaloGANtainer allows the training of this tool on more powerful devices such as High Performance Computing clusters and reduces software dependencies on local or distributed file systems (such as CVMFS). We describe the testing methodology and the results obtained on different resources with different operating systems and installed software, with or without GPUs.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2816903,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4917910,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796583\/attachments\/2816903\/4917910\/ATL-COM-SOFT-2024-011.pdf","title":"ATL-COM-SOFT-2024-011.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-11T12:04:53.849672+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"ATL-COM-SOFT-2024-011.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":1001889,"checksum":"0c90e839735ab97fe530dbc2b912f93e"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796583\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Joshua Falco","last_name":"Beirer","fullName":"Beirer, Joshua Falco","id":"8503941","affiliation":"Georg August Universitaet Goettingen (DE)","emailHash":"ae2c2eac8ce2bac30d7857756c9c3ca7","db_id":8503941,"person_id":8285951},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Joshua Falco","last_name":"Beirer","fullName":"Beirer, Joshua Falco","id":"8503940","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"c0f2823d4969bfc536ce9cf25b438e22","db_id":8503940,"person_id":8097274}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Federico Andrea","last_name":"Corchia","fullName":"Corchia, Federico Andrea","id":"8425981","affiliation":"Universita e INFN, Bologna (IT)","emailHash":"2cee961dfba9ed7b6fb30cebe2d6c046","db_id":8425981,"person_id":8103962},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Joshua Falco","last_name":"Beirer","fullName":"Beirer, Joshua Falco","id":"8503941","affiliation":"Georg August Universitaet Goettingen (DE)","emailHash":"ae2c2eac8ce2bac30d7857756c9c3ca7","db_id":8503941,"person_id":8285951},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Joshua Falco","last_name":"Beirer","fullName":"Beirer, Joshua Falco","id":"8503940","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"c0f2823d4969bfc536ce9cf25b438e22","db_id":8503940,"person_id":8097274},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Lorenzo","last_name":"Rinaldi","fullName":"Rinaldi, Lorenzo","id":"8425980","affiliation":"Universita e INFN, Bologna (IT)","emailHash":"8d12b3251e8d70d1668b59315dc88134","db_id":8425980,"person_id":8103961},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Michele","last_name":"Faucci Giannelli","fullName":"Faucci Giannelli, Michele","id":"8425979","affiliation":"INFN e Universita Roma Tor Vergata (IT)","emailHash":"b599f4a9469b5ebe0ca1932a087a8722","db_id":8425979,"person_id":8103963},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Rui","last_name":"Zhang","fullName":"Zhang, Rui","id":"8425982","affiliation":"University of Wisconsin Madison (US)","emailHash":"96ea8f0abd01f34e888672ab02ef3caf","db_id":8425982,"person_id":8094395}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","session":"Poster session with coffee break","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"49","db_id":5796580,"friendly_id":49,"title":"The ATLAS Web Run Control system","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"21:15:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"21:45:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":30,"roomFullname":"","room":"","note":{},"location":"Charles B. Wang Center, Stony Brook University","type":"Poster","description":"The ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) operated very successfully in the years 2008 to 2023. ATLAS Control and Configuration (CC) software is the core part of the ATLAS Trigger and DAQ system, it comprises all the software required to configure and control the ATLAS data taking. It provides essentially the glue that holds the various ATLAS sub-systems together. During recent years, more and more applications in CC software were made available as web applications, thus making them easily available to experts for remote operations. The important missing part, however, was the main data taking control and monitoring application known as 'Igui' (Integrated Graphical User Interface), the front-end GUI tool used by operators in ATLAS Control Room to steer the data taking sessions.\r\nThis paper presents the new web application called 'WebRC' (Web Run Control), which provides Igui-like functionality of the data taking monitoring and control from a web browser, including: presenting the Run Control tree of all applications, dynamically updating their states, browsing their log files and messages stream, monitoring different system and trigger rates and detector busy information, thus allowing experts to promptly assess the state of the data taking and to investigate possible issues.\r\nWebRC is built using Apache Wicket framework, and it is java-only back-end application. Important requirement which led to this choice was the necessity to closely integrate with CC services at the back-end side, with high performance and high scalability in mind. Another aspect is the long-term maintainability of the code, where in case of Wicket we benefit from not having to maintain any front-end JS library: on the browser side, a Wicket application is a plain HTML markup page, and all graphical elements management is fully done in Java on the server side. Wicket leverages the standard HTTP and AJAX technologies for achieving dynamic behavior of the application.\r\nWebRC can operate in two modes, Control and Display, where the former allows to fully control user data taking session by sending control commands to the applications. Recent development includes integration of WebRC with CERN IT Open-ID authentication infrastructure, allowing the actions to be performed on behalf of the user authenticated in CERN SSO page in a web browser, thus enabling full user control over TDAQ data taking sessions, including changes in the DAQ configuration, sending of RC commands and starting and stopping the DAQ session processes. However this mode is disabled for operations in ATLAS, where WebRC is running in Display mode.\r\nWebRC is widely used for monitoring of data taking sessions during ongoing Run 3 period, with dozens of users connecting daily.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2817212,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4918531,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796580\/attachments\/2817212\/4918531\/ATLASTDAQWebRunControl_36x24.pdf","title":"ATLASTDAQWebRunControl_36x24.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-11T14:53:19.135251+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"ATLASTDAQWebRunControl_36x24.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":730073,"checksum":"a0844a570d982249e0f395131fcad3d2"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796580\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Aimilianos","last_name":"Koulouris","fullName":"Koulouris, Aimilianos","id":"8498269","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"f9b16daa9ad4c4b4d59d68c62a42fa36","db_id":8498269,"person_id":8280241}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Aimilianos","last_name":"Koulouris","fullName":"Koulouris, Aimilianos","id":"8498269","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"f9b16daa9ad4c4b4d59d68c62a42fa36","db_id":8498269,"person_id":8280241},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alexander","last_name":"Oh","fullName":"Oh, Alexander","id":"8425976","affiliation":"University of Manchester (GB)","emailHash":"c04174695d6059bcc97fc933169c2a0b","db_id":8425976,"person_id":8103936},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Andrei","last_name":"Kazarov","fullName":"Kazarov, Andrei","id":"8498270","affiliation":"University of Johannesburg (SA)","emailHash":"60fbebcb15ff7b13c1be15b3b59d77fc","db_id":8498270,"person_id":8280242}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","session":"Poster session with coffee break","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"42","db_id":5796570,"friendly_id":42,"title":"Energy consumption characterization of Subnuclear Physics computing workloads","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"21:15:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"21:45:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":30,"roomFullname":"","room":"","note":{},"location":"Charles B.

While many modern scientific discoveries have been obtained thanks to the availability of more and more performing computers and algorithms, the energy and carbon footprint related to powering and exploiting such technologies is often underacknowledged. Since hardware-related improvements (i.e. Moore's Law and Dennard Scaling) are considered close to reach a *plateau*, this underestimation might lead, in the near future, the computing sector to become unsustainable for the environment and economically unaccessible for researchers.\r\nInvestigations in computing sustainability mainly took into account the hardware lifecycle, the focus being curbing the footprint related to resource provisioning and de-commisioning phases. Today, due to the pervasiveness of computing, it is becoming evident that resource exploitation must be taken into account too. Some computing niches, AI as an example, are indeed starting to shed some light on the usage of computing resources in their sector in order to understand how can their research be kept as energy efficient as reasonably possible. Nonetheless, the energy impact of many other scientific applications is typically only vaguely outlined.\r\nWith the goal of encouraging a better footprint description of computing activities in physics, in this work we show the footprint of computing workloads belonging to the branch of Subnuclear physics. We focus on the performance-related interplay between workload type, CPUs and energy usage. This data is expected to characterize the resource usage and offer actionable insights for curbing their energy eagerness.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2816128,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4916233,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796570\/attachments\/2816128\/4916233\/posterACAT_final.pdf","title":"posterACAT_final.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-08T14:31:43.876384+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"posterACAT_final.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":605345,"checksum":"59c2f5289110a2d37f23eee6442018ff"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796570\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Marco","last_name":"Lorusso","fullName":"Lorusso, Marco","id":"8503917","affiliation":"","emailHash":"e40b767cf02a49baaa53c34c1c45939c","db_id":8503917,"person_id":8285921},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Marco","last_name":"Lorusso","fullName":"Lorusso, Marco","id":"8503916","affiliation":"","emailHash":"78edbca50a51183c3a8852c891574355","db_id":8503916,"person_id":8285920},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Marco","last_name":"Lorusso","fullName":"Lorusso, Marco","id":"8503915","affiliation":"Universita Di Bologna (IT)","emailHash":"397b00113cdae0e9c31d5698969cf2bd","db_id":8503915,"person_id":8100463}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Francesco","last_name":"Minarini","fullName":"Minarini, Francesco","id":"8425925","affiliation":"","emailHash":"79240441b4fc52ec3a678790c413821a","db_id":8425925,"person_id":8100567},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Marco","last_name":"Lorusso","fullName":"Lorusso, Marco","id":"8503917","affiliation":"","emailHash":"e40b767cf02a49baaa53c34c1c45939c","db_id":8503917,"person_id":8285921},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Marco","last_name":"Lorusso","fullName":"Lorusso, Marco","id":"8503916","affiliation":"","emailHash":"78edbca50a51183c3a8852c891574355","db_id":8503916,"person_id":8285920},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Marco","last_name":"Lorusso","fullName":"Lorusso, Marco","id":"8503915","affiliation":"Universita Di Bologna (IT)","emailHash":"397b00113cdae0e9c31d5698969cf2bd","db_id":8503915,"person_id":8100463}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","session":"Poster session with coffee break","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"41","db_id":5796569,"friendly_id":41,"title":"Offline data processing in the First JUNO Data Challenge","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"21:15:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"21:45:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":30,"roomFullname":"","room":"","note":{},"location":"Charles B.

The data processing in JUNO is challenging. When JUNO starts data taking in the late 2024, the expected event rate is about 1 kHz, which is about 31.5 billions of events per year. About 60 MB of byte-stream raw data is produced every second, which is about 2 PB per year. The raw data is transferred from the JUNO onsite to the IHEP data center via a dedicated network. At IHEP data center, the raw data is preprocessed and converted to the ROOT-based raw data format (RTRAW). Then both raw and RTRAW data are replicated to the other data centers, including CC-IN2P3, INFN-CNAF and JINR. There are several critical components in the data processing, such as data quality monitoring (DQM), keep up reconstruction (KUP) and physics production (PP).\r\n\r\nA series of JUNO Data Challenges are proposed to evaluate and validate the complete data processing chain in advance. In this contribution, the offline data processing in the first JUNO Data Challenge (DC-1) will be presented. The major goal of DC-1 is processing 1-week of RTRAW data with conditions database and multi-threaded reconstruction. The workflow consists of production of the 45 TB of simulated RTRAW data and reconstruction of the RTRAW data in DQM, KUP and PP. In order to test the conditions database, 7 batches of conditions data are prepared and added in the simulation, then these conditions data are loaded from database in the reconstruction. The tests show that the conditions data are loaded correctly when new events are loaded. A JUNO-Hackathon is organized to let the core software experts and algorithm developers work together in order to support the multi-threaded reconstruction algorithms in the DC-1. The multi-threaded reconstructions are performed well within local computing resources and distributed computing resources respectively.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2813760,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4911567,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796569\/attachments\/2813760\/4911567\/lintao_ACAT2024_Poster%20(v0.1).pdf","title":"lintao_ACAT2024_Poster (v0.1).pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-06T06:35:24.349532+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"lintao_ACAT2024_Poster (v0.1).pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":300759,"checksum":"94170b1175627464a7c110f5ecbf1a86"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796569\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Tao","last_name":"Lin","fullName":"Lin, Tao","id":"8425924","affiliation":"Chinese Academy of Sciences (CN)","emailHash":"2fbe5cd266635003b02a2e156624828b","db_id":8425924,"person_id":8100480}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Tao","last_name":"Lin","fullName":"Lin, Tao","id":"8425924","affiliation":"Chinese Academy of Sciences (CN)","emailHash":"2fbe5cd266635003b02a2e156624828b","db_id":8425924,"person_id":8100480}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","session":"Poster session with coffee break","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"35","db_id":5796566,"friendly_id":35,"title":"Boosting CPU Efficiency in ATLAS Inner Detector Reconstruction with Track Overlay","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"21:15:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"21:45:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":30,"roomFullname":"","room":"","note":{},"location":"Charles B.

The track overlay approach involves pre-reconstructing pileup tracks and subsequently running reconstruction exclusively on hard-scatter tracks. This allows us to conserve valuable CPU resources by concentrating on events of interest. Integral to track overlay is the incorporation of machine learning (ML)-based decision processes. ML decisions guide the selection of events suitable for track overlay, while events in denser environments continue to use the standard overlay. This strategy ensures judicious use of resources, balancing efficiency and precision in inner detector reconstruction. This presentation focuses on constructing the ML model and verifying the workflow with ML decisions. The improvement of the track overlay approach on CPU usage and the reduction in the size of standard data format files in the Run 3 detector setup are also demonstrated. Preliminary results in the context of the forthcoming ITk inner detector at HL-LHC will be presented as well.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2817397,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4918948,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796566\/attachments\/2817397\/4918948\/Poster_ACAT24_TrackOverlay_Draft2.pdf","title":"Poster_ACAT24_TrackOverlay_Draft2.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-11T19:58:59.576930+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"Poster_ACAT24_TrackOverlay_Draft2.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":821780,"checksum":"2609e58ba74b8692a6989d7c57cbc8e0"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796566\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Fang-Ying","last_name":"Tsai","fullName":"Tsai, Fang-Ying","id":"8425914","affiliation":"Stony Brook University (US)","emailHash":"91dcc7088c2173a1434b8edb4c27c11e","db_id":8425914,"person_id":8099301}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Dominik","last_name":"Duda","fullName":"Duda, Dominik","id":"8425917","affiliation":"The University of Edinburgh (GB)","emailHash":"ec7fa9e6fa246e68ca0d5b735d103dda","db_id":8425917,"person_id":8099299},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Fang-Ying","last_name":"Tsai","fullName":"Tsai, Fang-Ying","id":"8425914","affiliation":"Stony Brook University (US)","emailHash":"91dcc7088c2173a1434b8edb4c27c11e","db_id":8425914,"person_id":8099301},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"John Derek","last_name":"Chapman","fullName":"Chapman, John Derek","id":"8425915","affiliation":"University of Cambridge (GB)","emailHash":"ae833af8243d4f9cefdd171d853ef91a","db_id":8425915,"person_id":8096558},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Martina","last_name":"Javurkova","fullName":"Javurkova, Martina","id":"8425918","affiliation":"University of Massachusetts (US)","emailHash":"64d6b9f19a8fcd50b7e99226bb5102ae","db_id":8425918,"person_id":8096562},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"Jiggins","fullName":"Jiggins, Stephen","id":"8425916","affiliation":"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DE)","emailHash":"8c68cdf1dadd45d04f43b03e67817ce0","db_id":8425916,"person_id":8099300}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","session":"Poster session with coffee break","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"31","db_id":5796564,"friendly_id":31,"title":"Describe Data to get Science-Data-Ready Tooling: Awkward as a Target for Kaitai Struct YAML","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"21:15:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"21:45:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":30,"roomFullname":"","room":"","note":{},"location":"Charles B.

Researchers need to develop, document, and maintain specific analysis software to interact with these data formats. These software are often tightly coupled with a particular data format. This proliferation of custom data formats has been a prominent challenge for small to mid-scale experiments. The widespread adoption of ROOT has largely mitigated this problem for the  Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments. However, not all experiments use ROOT for their data formats. Experiments such as Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) continue to use custom data formats to meet specific research needs. Therefore, simplifying the process of converting a unique data format to analysis code still holds immense value for scientific communities even beyond HEP. We have added Awkward Arrays, a Scikit-HEP library for storing nested and variable data into Numpy-like arrays, as a target language for Kaitai Struct for this purpose. \r\n\r\nKaitai Struct is a declarative language that uses a YAML-like description of a binary data structure to generate the code to read a raw data file in any of the supported languages. Researchers can simply describe their custom data format in the Kaitai Struct YAML (KSY) language only once. The Kaitai Struct Compiler generates C++ code to fill the LayoutBuilder buffers using the KSY format. In a few simple steps, the Kaitai Struct Awkward Runtime API can convert the generated C++ code into a compiled Python module using ctypes. Finally, the raw data file can be passed to the module to produce Awkward Arrays.\r\n\r\nThis talk will introduce the Awkward Target for the Kaitai Struct Compiler and the Kaitai Struct Awkward Runtime API. It will demonstrate the conversion of a given KSY for a specific custom file format to Awkward Arrays.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2815081,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4918821,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796564\/attachments\/2815081\/4918821\/Describe%20Data%20to%20get%20Science-Data-Ready%20Tooling%20Awkward%20Target%20for%20KSY.pdf","title":"Describe Data to get Science-Data-Ready Tooling Awkward Target for KSY.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-11T16:40:58.004009+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"Describe Data to get Science-Data-Ready Tooling Awkward Target for KSY.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":2959569,"checksum":"579fbd1ae5be3fb8caef9d45afe5ee64"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796564\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Manasvi","last_name":"Goyal","fullName":"Goyal, Manasvi","id":"8425908","affiliation":"Princeton University (US)","emailHash":"65294ee9743d55339d1fcf7e767a445a","db_id":8425908,"person_id":8097287}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Manasvi","last_name":"Goyal","fullName":"Goyal, Manasvi","id":"8425908","affiliation":"Princeton University (US)","emailHash":"65294ee9743d55339d1fcf7e767a445a","db_id":8425908,"person_id":8097287},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Ianna","last_name":"Osborne","fullName":"Osborne, Ianna","id":"8425909","affiliation":"Princeton University","emailHash":"f21b8b4cdfe52093bc94315ab210d323","db_id":8425909,"person_id":8097286},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jim","last_name":"Pivarski","fullName":"Pivarski, Jim","id":"8425907","affiliation":"Princeton University","emailHash":"34e33630030667a84c9fc9c53facc1f3","db_id":8425907,"person_id":8097283},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Amy","last_name":"Roberts","fullName":"Roberts, Amy","id":"8425910","affiliation":"University of Colorado Denver","emailHash":"c392741fb2641f502e4c4f812643c025","db_id":8425910,"person_id":8097285},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Andrea","last_name":"Zonca","fullName":"Zonca, Andrea","id":"8425911","affiliation":"","emailHash":"fece7d0ad29a9de15d71082d54b9042c","db_id":8425911,"person_id":8097284}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","session":"Poster session with coffee break","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"29","db_id":5796510,"friendly_id":29,"title":"AtlFast3: Fast Simulation in ATLAS for LHC Run 3 and beyond","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"21:15:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"21:45:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":30,"roomFullname":"","room":"","note":{},"location":"Charles B.

ATLAS currently expends around 40% of its CPU resources on detector simulation, in which half of the events are produced with full simulation using GEANT4. Fast Chain provides a quicker alternative to the standard ATLAS MC production chain (full simulation). \r\n\r\nThe Fast ATLAS Track Simulation (FATRAS), which simulates charged particles passing through complex magnetic and calorimetric systems, has been seamlessly integrated into the ATLAS fast simulation pipeline. This integration accelerates the simulation process and maintains high precision in reproducing particle interactions within the ATLAS inner detector using a simplified detector geometry and a parameterization of particle interactions with the detector material. Recent updates to the FATRAS have focused on improving its modeling of particle interactions, extending its applicability to a broader range of physics scenarios, and enhancing its efficiency for large-scale simulations. For High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), the ATLAS experiment aims to use mostly fast simulation and plans to migrate the current FATRAS to a multithread-compatible version, ACTS-FATRAS. We will discuss specific features and performance benchmarks of the updated FATRAS-integrated ATLAS fast simulation, showcasing its capabilities in accurately reproducing the physics processes of interest and the impact on reducing computational resources required for large-scale simulation campaigns.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2816438,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4916970,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796509\/attachments\/2816438\/4916970\/Fatras_h.pdf","title":"Fatras_h.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-10T16:25:30.549885+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"Fatras_h.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":4539894,"checksum":"1ac28e11a764ee3b3641be38afd055a9"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796509\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Rui","last_name":"Wang","fullName":"Wang, Rui","id":"8425770","affiliation":"Argonne National Laboratory (US)","emailHash":"442ce6794cf5be46cfae4c74ec5d3186","db_id":8425770,"person_id":8096560}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Dmitry","last_name":"Shemyakin","fullName":"Shemyakin, Dmitry","id":"8425771","affiliation":"Weizmann Institute of Science (IL)","emailHash":"277841d351e51c62b02fde58664de25a","db_id":8425771,"person_id":8096559},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"John Derek","last_name":"Chapman","fullName":"Chapman, John Derek","id":"8425768","affiliation":"University of Cambridge (GB)","emailHash":"ae833af8243d4f9cefdd171d853ef91a","db_id":8425768,"person_id":8096558},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Liza","last_name":"Mijovic","fullName":"Mijovic, Liza","id":"8425769","affiliation":"University of Edinburgh","emailHash":"4fe40566d6fca776d663db55640a34f9","db_id":8425769,"person_id":8096561},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Martina","last_name":"Javurkova","fullName":"Javurkova, Martina","id":"8425767","affiliation":"University of Massachusetts (US)","emailHash":"64d6b9f19a8fcd50b7e99226bb5102ae","db_id":8425767,"person_id":8096562},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Rui","last_name":"Wang","fullName":"Wang, Rui","id":"8425770","affiliation":"Argonne National Laboratory (US)","emailHash":"442ce6794cf5be46cfae4c74ec5d3186","db_id":8425770,"person_id":8096560}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","session":"Poster session with coffee break","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"27","db_id":5796507,"friendly_id":27,"title":"Athena MPI: A Multi-Node Version of ATLAS's Athena Framework, Using Message Passing Interface","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"21:15:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"21:45:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":30,"roomFullname":"","room":"","note":{},"location":"Charles B.

Wang Center, Stony Brook University","type":"Poster","description":"The interTwin project, funded by the European Commission, is at the forefront of leveraging 'Digital Twins' across various scientific domains, with a particular emphasis on physics and earth observation. Two of the most advanced use-cases of interTwin are event generation for particle detector simulation at CERN as well as the climate-based Environmental Modelling and Prediction Platform (EMP2) jointly developed at CERN and the Julich Supercomputing Center (JSC) using foundation models. interTwin enables those use-cases to leverage AI methodologies on cloud to high-performance computing (HPC) resources by using itwinai - the AI workflow and method lifecycle module of interTwin.\r\n\r\nThe itwinai module is developed collaboratively by CERN and JSC and is a pivotal contribution within the interTwin project. Its role is advancing interdisciplinary scientific research through the synthesis of learning and computing paradigms. This framework stands as a testament to the commitment of the interTwin project towards co-designing and implementing an interdisciplinary Digital Twin Engine. Its main functionalities and contributions are:\r\n\r\n**Distributed Training:** itwinai offers a streamlined approach to distributing existing code across multiple GPUs and nodes, automating the training workflow. Leveraging industry-standard backends, including PyTorch Distributed Data Parallel (DDP), TensorFlow distributed strategies, and Horovod, it provides researchers with a robust foundation for efficient and scalable distributed training. The successful deployment and testing of itwinai on JSC's HDFML cluster underscore its practical applicability in real-world scenarios.\r\n\r\n**Hyperparameter Optimization:** One of the core functionalities of itwinai is its hyperparameter optimization, which plays a crucial role in enhancing model accuracy. By intelligently exploring hyperparameter spaces, itwinai eliminates the need for manual parameter tuning. The functionality, empowered by RayTune, contributes significantly to the development of more robust and accurate scientific models.\r\n\r\n**Model Registry:** A key aspect of itwinai is its provision of a robust model registry. This feature allows researchers to log and store models along with associated performance metrics, thereby enabling comprehensive analyses in a convenient manner. The backend, leveraging MLFlow, ensures seamless model management, enhancing collaboration and reproducibility.\r\n\r\nIn line with the theme of the 2024 ACAT workshop, \"Foundation Models for Physics,\" interTwin and its use-cases empowered by itwinai are positioned at the convergence of computation and physics and showcase the significant potential of foundation models, supported by HPC resources. Together, they contribute to a narrative of interconnected scientific frontiers, where the integration of digital twins, AI frameworks, and foundation models broadens possibilities for exploration and discovery through itwinai\u2019s user-friendly interface and powerful functionalities.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2817440,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4919034,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5792182\/attachments\/2817440\/4919034\/interTwin_poster_v3.pdf","title":"interTwin_poster_v3.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-12T00:29:28.243787+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"interTwin_poster_v3.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":1429178,"checksum":"f372530514ff7ddc62d705a08230c679"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5792182\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alexander","last_name":"Zoechbauer","fullName":"Zoechbauer, Alexander","id":"8418755","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"6462f226b6a43ccd1a9016fba554f0d6","db_id":8418755,"person_id":8096285}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alexander","last_name":"Zoechbauer","fullName":"Zoechbauer, Alexander","id":"8418755","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"6462f226b6a43ccd1a9016fba554f0d6","db_id":8418755,"person_id":8096285},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Ilaria","last_name":"Luise","fullName":"Luise, Ilaria","id":"8418758","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"b5a96b52924b123776086c801d0e18c6","db_id":8418758,"person_id":8096286},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Kalliopi","last_name":"Tsolaki","fullName":"Tsolaki, Kalliopi","id":"8418759","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"88fe5c55c927bead27c1d51b217d41f0","db_id":8418759,"person_id":8096283},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Maria","last_name":"Girone","fullName":"Girone, Maria","id":"8418757","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"059c67f423c94e588bce78fb5a617463","db_id":8418757,"person_id":8096281},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Matteo","last_name":"Bunino","fullName":"Bunino, Matteo","id":"8418760","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"e0c82728aa4ba45b6e6d83b5ba1e1771","db_id":8418760,"person_id":8096282},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sofia","last_name":"Vallecorsa","fullName":"Vallecorsa, Sofia","id":"8418756","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"42eeb1ebb171454cf2f5b652c7168a8c","db_id":8418756,"person_id":8096284}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","session":"Poster session with coffee break","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"14","db_id":5796835,"friendly_id":14,"title":"Interface to Unity for High Energy Physics detector visualization","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"21:15:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"21:45:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":30,"roomFullname":"","room":"","note":{},"location":"Charles B.

This process hinges on meticulously evaluating a worker node's suitability for the given task, necessitating a thorough assessment of its infrastructure characteristics. However, adjusting job matching parameters poses a significant challenge due to the involvement of both central and site services within the Grid middleware. This necessitates deploying a new middleware version across the entire Grid, introducing potential bugs and raising the risk of a single point of failure.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the inherent limitations in the number of available job matching parameters, stemming from insufficient infrastructure monitoring in pilot jobs, further complicate the task for Grid middleware developers.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis paper introduces an entirely new approach for dynamically adding and modifying job matching parameters in Grid middleware, leveraging the Site Sonar Grid Infrastructure monitoring framework. This solution empowers Grid administrators to seamlessly add or modify job matching parameters without altering the core middleware code. This flexibility enables dynamic job matching based on diverse infrastructure properties of worker nodes. By decoupling job matching parameters from the Grid middleware, the proposed approach enhances flexibility, mitigates complexities, and reduces risks associated with introducing and changing job matching parameters.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis transformative approach bolsters the adaptability of Grid middleware for heterogeneous systems, fostering optimized resource allocation.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2816505,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4917088,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796491\/attachments\/2816505\/4917088\/ACAT%20poster.pdf","title":"ACAT poster.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-11T02:31:44.822369+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"ACAT poster.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":5033696,"checksum":"1f87bf61992eaf10e76c31b682ad142b"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796491\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Kalana","last_name":"Wijethunga","fullName":"Wijethunga, Kalana","id":"8425683","affiliation":"University of Moratuwa (LK)","emailHash":"4e177952af1a7b0c31cb6a731ec822d6","db_id":8425683,"person_id":8065232}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Kalana","last_name":"Wijethunga","fullName":"Wijethunga, Kalana","id":"8425683","affiliation":"University of Moratuwa (LK)","emailHash":"4e177952af1a7b0c31cb6a731ec822d6","db_id":8425683,"person_id":8065232}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Costin","last_name":"Grigoras","fullName":"Grigoras, Costin","id":"8425680","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"a03bb0b3b47a554f9eb69c2fca89dcb7","db_id":8425680,"person_id":8065231},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Indika","last_name":"Perera","fullName":"Perera, Indika","id":"8425681","affiliation":"University of Moratuwa(LK)","emailHash":"f5e09f003d277673a796b116d6dac1b1","db_id":8425681,"person_id":8065230},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Latchezar","last_name":"Betev","fullName":"Betev, Latchezar","id":"8425682","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"2b4e5274e6b37fc772c4189e542d2d12","db_id":8425682,"person_id":8065229}],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","session":"Poster session with coffee break","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"152","db_id":5776139,"friendly_id":152,"title":"Sustainable computing and the MLPerf project","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-12","time":"15:15:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-12","time":"15:45:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":30,"roomFullname":"Theatre","room":"Theatre","note":{},"location":" Charles B.

These segments are essential to form all good physics tracks with precision momentum measurement, when combined with those reconstructed in the vertex track detector, and to reconstruct long-lived particles, such as K-short and strange baryons, decaying after the vertex track detector. \r\nLHCb is currently developing a project for a new real-time tracking device based on distributed system of FPGAs, dedicated to the reconstruction of track primitives in the forward Scintillating Fibre tracker detector at the full LHC collision rate. The aim is to accelerate reconstruction in Run 4, and to develop this new technology in view of the higher instantaneous luminosity conditions foreseen for Run 5 (Upgrade II). In this talk we report the first detailed study of the reconstruction performance expected from this device, based on an accurate simulation of its architecture at the bit

In order to deliver an order of magnitude more data than previous LHC runs, 14 TeV protons will collide with an instantaneous luminosity of up to 7.5 x 10e34 cm^-2s^-1, resulting in higher pileup and data rates. This increase brings new requirements and challenges for the trigger and data acquisition system (TDAQ), as well as for the detector and computing systems.\r\n\r\nThe design of the TDAQ upgrade comprises:\r\n- a hardware-based low-latency real-time Trigger operating at 40 MHz,\r\n- data acquisition which combines custom readout with commodity hardware and networking to deal with 4.6 TB\/s input, and\r\n- an Event Filter running at 1 MHz which combines offline-like algorithms on a large commodity computing service with the potential to be augmented by commercial accelerators.\u00a0\r\nCommodity servers and networks are used as far as possible, with custom ATCA boards, high speed links and powerful FPGAs deployed in the low-latency parts of the system. Offline-style clustering and jet-finding in FPGAs, as well as accelerated track reconstruction are designed to combat pileup in the Trigger and Event Filter respectively.\r\n\r\nThis contribution will report recent progress on the design, technology and construction of the system. The physics motivation and expected performance will be shown for key physics processes.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2820301,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4924888,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796582\/attachments\/2820301\/4924888\/20240311-ACAT-TDAQP2.pdf","title":"20240311-ACAT-TDAQP2.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-14T19:25:33.403859+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"20240311-ACAT-TDAQP2.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":18562620,"checksum":"e77f987278e232c2d65325cea78e85d8"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796582\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Francesca","last_name":"Pastore","fullName":"Pastore, Francesca","id":"8498289","affiliation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","emailHash":"2eeb3379a2057671c059b93623ac5575","db_id":8498289,"person_id":8280269}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alexander","last_name":"Oh","fullName":"Oh, Alexander","id":"8425978","affiliation":"University of Manchester (GB)","emailHash":"c04174695d6059bcc97fc933169c2a0b","db_id":8425978,"person_id":8103936},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Francesca","last_name":"Pastore","fullName":"Pastore, Francesca","id":"8498289","affiliation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","emailHash":"2eeb3379a2057671c059b93623ac5575","db_id":8498289,"person_id":8280269}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","session":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"175","db_id":5796656,"friendly_id":175,"title":"Pinpoint resource allocation for GPU batch applications","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-14","time":"20:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-14","time":"20:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Theatre","room":"Theatre","note":{},"location":" Charles B.

For institutes, like the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), that provide GPU compute resources to HEP via their batch systems or the Grid, a high throughput, as well as energy efficient usage of their systems is of the essence. With low intensity GPU analyses specifically, inefficiencies are created by the standard scheduling, as resources are over-assigned to such workflows. An approach that is flexible enough to cover the entire spectrum, from multi-process per GPU, to multi-GPU per process, is necessary. As a follow-up to the techniques presented at the 2022 ACAT, this time we study Nvidia's multi-process service (MPS), its ability to securely distribute device memory and its interplay with the KIT HTCondor batch system. A number of ML applications were benchmarked using this less demanding and more flexible approach to illustrate the performance implications regarding throughput and energy efficiency.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2819828,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4924765,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796656\/attachments\/2819828\/4924765\/Pinpoint_resource_allocation_for_GPU_batch_applications.pdf","title":"Pinpoint_resource_allocation_for_GPU_batch_applications.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-14T16:59:04.352536+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"Pinpoint_resource_allocation_for_GPU_batch_applications.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":1866921,"checksum":"8e200dde11aa54128998ae3c7bf0fd11"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796656\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Tim","last_name":"Voigtlaender","fullName":"Voigtlaender, Tim","id":"8426359","affiliation":"KIT - Karlsruhe Institute of  Technology (DE)","emailHash":"4a96e684353fbaeda8fa6b51d4fb1d7b","db_id":8426359,"person_id":8198245}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Tim","last_name":"Voigtlaender","fullName":"Voigtlaender, Tim","id":"8426359","affiliation":"KIT - Karlsruhe Institute of  Technology (DE)","emailHash":"4a96e684353fbaeda8fa6b51d4fb1d7b","db_id":8426359,"person_id":8198245}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Gunter","last_name":"Quast","fullName":"Quast, Gunter","id":"8426358","affiliation":"KIT - Karlsruhe Institute of  Technology (DE)","emailHash":"7aba38cfa2a99bc621b6076d46ea0ab9","db_id":8426358,"person_id":8161863},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Manuel","last_name":"Giffels","fullName":"Giffels, Manuel","id":"8426355","affiliation":"KIT - Karlsruhe Institute of  Technology (DE)","emailHash":"4535f96fcde7dd5d7c121710acfa24cd","db_id":8426355,"person_id":8161864},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Matthias Jochen","last_name":"Schnepf","fullName":"Schnepf, Matthias Jochen","id":"8426356","affiliation":"","emailHash":"4af3151f7ba0d19eeba9bbec003feea3","db_id":8426356,"person_id":8161862},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Roger","last_name":"Wolf","fullName":"Wolf, Roger","id":"8426357","affiliation":"KIT - Karlsruhe Institute of  Technology (DE)","emailHash":"68161982ef52c50d3b1b4c74c978854c","db_id":8426357,"person_id":8198246}],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","session":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"109","db_id":5796644,"friendly_id":109,"title":"Fully containerised approach for the HPC cluster at FAIR","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-14","time":"19:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-14","time":"20:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Theatre","room":"Theatre","note":{},"location":" Charles B.

Wang Center, Stony Brook University ","type":"Oral","description":"Recent advancements in track finding within the challenging environments expected in the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) have showcased the potential of Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based algorithms. These algorithms exhibit high track efficiency and reasonable resolutions, yet their computational burden on CPUs hinders real-time processing, necessitating the integration of accelerators like GPUs. However, the substantial size of the involved graphs, with approximately 300k nodes and 1M edges, demands significant GPU memory, posing a challenge for facilities lacking high-end GPUs such as NVIDIA A100s or V100s. These computing challenges must be addressed to deploy GNN-based track finding or any algorithm that requires coprocessors, into production.\r\n\r\nTo overcome these challenges, we propose the as-a-service approach to deploy the GNN-based track-finding algorithm in the cloud or high-performance computing centers such as the NERSC Perlmutter system with over 7000 A100 GPUs. In addressing this, we have developed a tracking-as-a-service prototype within A Common Tracking Software (ACTS), an experiment-independent toolkit for charged particle track reconstruction.\r\n\r\nThe GNN-based track finding is implemented as a service within ACTS, showcasing its versatility as a demonstrator. Moreover, this approach is algorithm-agnostic, allowing the incorporation of other algorithms as new backends through interactions with the client interface implemented in ACTS.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, we present the implementation of the GNN-based track-finding workflow as a service using the Nvidia Triton Inference Server within ACTS. The GNN pipeline comprises three distinct deep-learning models and two CUDA-based algorithms, enabling full tracking reconstruction within ACTS. We explore different server configurations to assess track-finding throughput and GPU utilization, exploring the scalability of the inference server across the NERSC Perlmutter supercomputer and cloud resources such as AWS and Google Cloud.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2820244,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4924638,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796611\/attachments\/2820244\/4924638\/ACTS_as_a_service_ACAT2024.pdf","title":"ACTS_as_a_service_ACAT2024.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-14T15:56:12.054642+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"ACTS_as_a_service_ACAT2024.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":2761829,"checksum":"02e65be787fd9afd52d1633b27c57c89"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796611\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Yuan-Tang","last_name":"Chou","fullName":"Chou, Yuan-Tang","id":"8426187","affiliation":"University of Washington (US)","emailHash":"a5a8537aea5965f032d88102ffe56e5a","db_id":8426187,"person_id":8105184}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Haoran","last_name":"Zhao","fullName":"Zhao, Haoran","id":"8426186","affiliation":"University of Washington (US)","emailHash":"e8e4a05614ac9be1f385446f761e5724","db_id":8426186,"person_id":8105182},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Xiangyang","last_name":"Ju","fullName":"Ju, Xiangyang","id":"8426198","affiliation":"Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

As a result, High Energy Physics experiments must make maximum use of these accelerators in our pipelines to ensure efficient use of the resources available to us.\r\n\r\nThe ATLAS and LHCb experiments share a common data processing architecture called Gaudi. In Gaudi, data processing workloads are ultimately split into units called Algorithms, and Gaudi uses a smart scheduler (the Avalanche scheduler) to schedule these Algorithms on a fixed pool of CPU threads managed by Intel\u2019s TBB.\r\n\r\nThis is an architecture that efficiently fills the available CPU capacity provided the algorithms are primarily CPU-limited. However when the algorithms offload a large portion of their computational work to GPUs they can be left blocking a CPU thread, wasting precious core-time. \r\n\r\nHere we present a prototype of an addition to this scheduler, which places such GPU-accelerated algorithms on a separate pool of dedicated threads. By making use of lightweight Boost Fibers, and the ability to suspend these fibers without suspending the underlying OS thread, we can run the GPU workload asynchronously, without blocking the thread. This allows more efficient use of the CPU resources, and where the work offloaded by a single Algorithm doesn\u2019t fill the GPU resources available can also improve GPU-efficiency by making use of separate CUDA streams.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2819342,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4922844,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796574\/attachments\/2819342\/4922844\/AsyncAlg.pdf","title":"AsyncAlg.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-13T16:26:12.367331+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"AsyncAlg.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":4532978,"checksum":"63d69f0af7f0759c87a158b8591beb7e"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796574\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Beojan","last_name":"Stanislaus","fullName":"Stanislaus, Beojan","id":"8425933","affiliation":"Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

It is expected to remain a key component of the CMS Offline Software for the foreseeable future. Consequently, CMSSW is under continuous development, with its integration system evolving to incorporate modern tools and keep pace with the latest software improvements in the High Energy Physics (HEP) community. This contribution presents an in-depth examination of the recent enhancements made to the CMSSW infrastructure. Technical improvements, such as advanced compiler techniques like Link Time Optimization (LTO) and Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO), have been successfully integrated into the CMSSW infrastructure. Additionally, the adoption of heterogeneous resources and multi-vectorization architectures has contributed to a variety of software flavors and architectures, providing different approaches to identify bugs and legacy code at an early stage. To efficiently accommodate the increasing workloads of such techniques, the migration of the CernVM File System to a parallel publishing setup has also been engineered according to the experiment's needs. We will finally discuss the enhancement of the CMS Continuous Integration infrastructure, focusing on the adoption of new methods for monitoring and scheduling, testing, and integrating the software stack. Overall, these advancements in CMSSW have not only prepared it for the ongoing Run 3 but also underscore our commitment to continuously optimizing the CMS software infrastructure.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2819181,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4922564,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796567\/attachments\/2819181\/4922564\/ACAT2024-CMSSWOptimization-Valenzuela.pdf","title":"ACAT2024-CMSSWOptimization-Valenzuela.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-13T14:40:36.699602+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"ACAT2024-CMSSWOptimization-Valenzuela.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":1604437,"checksum":"8b4d1e0c39cae8cf0368406ce97a0930"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796567\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Andrea","last_name":"Valenzuela Ramirez","fullName":"Valenzuela Ramirez, Andrea","id":"8425921","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"97c7d9efb0f3cb1c0f8146ef4bb451fa","db_id":8425921,"person_id":8099354}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Andrea","last_name":"Valenzuela Ramirez","fullName":"Valenzuela Ramirez, Andrea","id":"8425921","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"97c7d9efb0f3cb1c0f8146ef4bb451fa","db_id":8425921,"person_id":8099354}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Ivan","last_name":"Razumov","fullName":"Razumov, Ivan","id":"8425919","affiliation":"Princeton University (US)","emailHash":"be5baae71e8768ab5590e0126ce1db0b","db_id":8425919,"person_id":8099355},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Malik Shahzad","last_name":"Muzaffar","fullName":"Muzaffar, Malik Shahzad","id":"8425920","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"4e0d9311bdd9ddd970e7cf2f86e61010","db_id":8425920,"person_id":8099353}],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","session":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"26","db_id":5796506,"friendly_id":26,"title":"Evaluating Application Characteristics for GPU Portability Layer Selection","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-13","time":"19:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-13","time":"19:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Theatre","room":"Theatre","note":{},"location":" Charles B.

Though NVIDIA is currently the main provider of GPUs, AMD and Intel are rapidly increasing their market share. As a result, programming using a vendor-specific language such as CUDA can significantly reduce deployment choices. There are a number of portability layers such as Kokkos, Alpaka, SYCL, OpenMP and std::par that permit execution on a broad range of GPU and CPU architectures, significantly increasing the flexibility of application programmers. However, each of these portability layers has its own characteristics, performing better at some tasks and worse at others, or placing limitations on aspects of the application. In this presentation, we report on a study of application and kernel characteristics that can influence the choice of a portability layer and show how each layer handles these characteristics. We have analyzed representative heterogeneous applications from CMS (patatrack and p2r), DUNE (Wire-Cell Toolkit), and ATLAS (FastCaloSim) to identify key application characteristics that have different behaviors for the various portability technologies. Using these results, developers can make more informed decisions on which GPU portability technology is best suited to their application.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2818993,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4922199,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796506\/attachments\/2818993\/4922199\/ACAT24%20Evaluating%20Applications%20for%20Portability.pdf","title":"ACAT24 Evaluating Applications for Portability.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-13T12:46:28.197224+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"ACAT24 Evaluating Applications for Portability.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":250868,"checksum":"e877e70bf0abdbea77000eeb93e18e81"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796506\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Charles","last_name":"Leggett","fullName":"Leggett, Charles","id":"8425756","affiliation":"Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (US)","emailHash":"287eff907e8b88ac28442324d4258129","db_id":8425756,"person_id":8096524}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Charles","last_name":"Leggett","fullName":"Leggett, Charles","id":"8425756","affiliation":"Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (US)","emailHash":"287eff907e8b88ac28442324d4258129","db_id":8425756,"person_id":8096524}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Brett","last_name":"Viren","fullName":"Viren, Brett","id":"8425753","affiliation":"Brookhaven National Laboratory","emailHash":"800fd332a461d0669051f78e934d3e39","db_id":8425753,"person_id":8096521},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"FNU","last_name":"Mohammad Atif","fullName":"Mohammad Atif, FNU","id":"8425754","affiliation":"Brookhaven National Laboratory","emailHash":"550d93a74264a3d44aa53d00ff895b65","db_id":8425754,"person_id":8096514},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Haiwang","last_name":"Yu","fullName":"Yu, Haiwang","id":"8425759","affiliation":"","emailHash":"10748272f64f34cc834eb28f69628c3d","db_id":8425759,"person_id":8096527},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Julien","last_name":"Esseiva","fullName":"Esseiva, Julien","id":"8425750","affiliation":"Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Wang Center, Stony Brook University ","type":"Oral","description":"The LHCb experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is designed to perform high-precision measurements of heavy-hadron decays, which requires the collection of large data samples and a good understanding and suppression of multiple background sources. Both factors are challenged by a five-fold increase in the average number of proton-proton collisions per bunch crossing, corresponding to a change in the detector operation conditions for the recently started LHC Run 3. The limits in the storage capacity of the trigger have brought an inverse relation between the number of particles selected to be stored per event and the number of events that can be recorded, and the background levels have risen due to the enlarged combinatorics. To tackle both challenges, we have proposed a novel approach, never attempted before in a hadronic collider: a Deep-learning based Full Event Interpretation (DFEI), to perform the simultaneous identification, isolation, and hierarchical reconstruction of all the heavy-hadron decay chains in each event. We have developed a prototype for such an algorithm based on Graph Neural Networks. The construction of the algorithm and its current performance have recently been described in a publication [Comput.Softw.Big Sci. 7 (2023) 1, 12]. This contribution will summarise the main findings in that paper. In addition, new developments towards speeding up the inference of the algorithm will be presented, as well as novel applications of DFEI for data analysis. The applications, showcased using simulated datasets, focus on decay-mode-inclusive studies and automated methods for background suppression\/characterization.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2818149,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4920485,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796657\/attachments\/2818149\/4920485\/ACAT_2024_FL_v5.pdf","title":"ACAT_2024_FL_v5.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-12T13:46:20.221170+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"ACAT_2024_FL_v5.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":2056873,"checksum":"e3955b90d4f98ef7556a453a5e975d76"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796657\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Felipe

The HL-LHC upgrade of the ATLAS detector brings an unprecedented tracking challenge, both in terms of number of silicon hit cluster readouts, and throughput required for both high level trigger and offline track reconstruction. Traditional track reconstruction techniques often contain steps that scale combinatorically, which could be ameliorated with deep learning approaches. The GNN4ITk project has been shown to apply geometric deep learning algorithms for tracking to a similar level of physics performance with traditional techniques, while scaling sub-quadratically. In this contribution, we provide comparisons of physics and computational performance across a variety of model configurations, as well as optimizations that reduce computational cost without significantly affecting physics performance. These include the use of structured pruning, knowledge distillation, simplified and customized convolutional kernels, regional tracking approaches, and GPU-optimized graph segmentation techniques.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2817970,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4920132,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796654\/attachments\/2817970\/4920132\/GNN4ITk%20ACAT%202024%20(2).pdf","title":"GNN4ITk ACAT 2024 (2).pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-12T12:42:16.019515+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"GNN4ITk ACAT 2024 (2).pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":3423175,"checksum":"76543cb1f2e81458bc755b41d690145e"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796654\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Daniel Thomas","last_name":"Murnane","fullName":"Murnane, Daniel Thomas","id":"8426352","affiliation":"Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Commonly used machine learning libraries, such as Keras and PyTorch, might provide functionality for inference, but they only support their own models, are constrained by heavy dependencies and often provide only a Python API and not a C++ one. SOFIE [13], which stands for System for Optimized Fast Inference code Emit, a part of the ROOT project developed at CERN, creates standalone C++ inference code from an input model in one of the popular machine learning formats.

This surge in versatility has uncovered new and promising avenues for enhancing data analysis in experiments conducted at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The integration of these advanced techniques has demonstrated considerable potential for elevating the efficiency and efficacy of data processing in this experimental setting.\r\nNevertheless, one frequently overlooked aspect of utilizing Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) revolves around the imperative of efficiently processing data for online applications. This becomes particularly crucial when exploring innovative methods for selecting intriguing events at the trigger level, as seen in the pursuit of Beyond Standard Model (BSM) events. The study delves into the potential of Autoencoders (AEs), an unbiased algorithm capable of event selection based on abnormality without relying on theoretical priors. However, the distinctive latency and energy constraints within the Level-1 Trigger domain necessitate tailored software development and deployment strategies. These strategies aim to optimize the utilization of on-site hardware, with a specific focus on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).\r\nThis is why a technique called Knowledge Distillation (KD) is studied in this work. It consists in using a large and well trained \u201cteacher\u201d, like the aforementioned AE, to train a much smaller student model which can be easily implemented on an FPGA. The optimization of this distillation process involves exploring different aspects, such as the architecture of the student and the quantization of weights and biases, with a strategic approach that includes hyperparameter searches to find the best compromise between accuracy, latency and hardware footprint.\r\nThe strategy followed to distill the teacher model will be presented, together with consideration on the difference in performance of applying the quantization before or after the best student model has been found. Finally, a second way to perform KD will be introduced called co-training distillation which sees the teacher and the student models trained at the same time.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2817056,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4918251,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796612\/attachments\/2817056\/4918251\/Acat__2024-4.pdf","title":"Acat__2024_Lorusso.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-11T21:40:14.747326+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"Acat__2024-4.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":1761060,"checksum":"35e7e54f482c3f60ff86b74577d522d7"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796612\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Marco","last_name":"Lorusso","fullName":"Lorusso, Marco","id":"8426199","affiliation":"Universita Di Bologna (IT)","emailHash":"397b00113cdae0e9c31d5698969cf2bd","db_id":8426199,"person_id":8100463}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Marco","last_name":"Lorusso","fullName":"Lorusso, Marco","id":"8426199","affiliation":"Universita Di Bologna (IT)","emailHash":"397b00113cdae0e9c31d5698969cf2bd","db_id":8426199,"person_id":8100463}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","session":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"74","db_id":5796609,"friendly_id":74,"title":"HPC Friendly HEP data model and RNTuple in HEP-CCE","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"22:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"23:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Theatre","room":"Theatre","note":{},"location":" Charles B.

In its first phase, the HEP-Center for Computational Excellence (HEP-CCE) has demonstrated that the complex HEP data products can be stored in the HPC native storage backends, such as HDF5, after converting them into byte stream serialization buffers. To efficiently leverage the HPC resources including compute accelerators such as GPUs, the storage format has to allow efficient I\/O on parallel file systems used on HPC and the data models have to be capable of being  offloaded to the GPUs for processing without conversions. In its second phase, HEP-CCE is studying the design and development of the HEP data models that will be HPC friendly and relevant for the future HEP experiments. At the same time, ROOT, an open data analysis framework, widely used by the HEP community, has been developing a new I\/O subsystem called ROOT::RNTuple. RNTuple optimizes performance and minimizes storage, which requires a more streamlined design than the current I\/O subsystem (ROOT::TTree) and hence has limited support on data model complexity. When designing data models suitable for offloading to compute accelerators, we also consider their storage in both HPC native backends (such as HDF5) and the more typical HEP persistence in ROOT::RNTuple. Both offloading and storage technologies have different restrictions to construct HEP data models. Only those data models that can take these restrictions into account can be truly HPC friendly and fulfill the requirements of future HEP experiments (including processing using grid resources). In this paper, we will show our results and ongoing works related to data model design and persistence of future HEP experimental data.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2816941,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4918897,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796609\/attachments\/2816941\/4918897\/ACAT-2024-HEP-CCE-Track1.pdf","title":"ACAT-2024-HEP-CCE-Track1.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-11T18:06:43.124492+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"ACAT-2024-HEP-CCE-Track1.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":891268,"checksum":"efdac4e9dd955ae62d9ae821721f2e9f"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796609\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Amit","last_name":"Bashyal","fullName":"Bashyal, Amit","id":"8426164","affiliation":"","emailHash":"5533d1e019eb0da9a1d505359c2ae58b","db_id":8426164,"person_id":8105160}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Amit","last_name":"Bashyal","fullName":"Bashyal, Amit","id":"8426164","affiliation":"","emailHash":"5533d1e019eb0da9a1d505359c2ae58b","db_id":8426164,"person_id":8105160}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Kyle","last_name":"Knoepfel","fullName":"Knoepfel, Kyle","id":"8426163","affiliation":"Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory","emailHash":"8ad121ca011a999be5805f7b551dcb7d","db_id":8426163,"person_id":8105161},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Meghna","last_name":"Bhattacharya","fullName":"Bhattacharya, Meghna","id":"8426162","affiliation":"Fermilab","emailHash":"51ca869ff9af20bcc2b841920ef686f9","db_id":8426162,"person_id":8096519},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Peter","last_name":"Van Gemmeren","fullName":"Van Gemmeren, Peter","id":"8426165","affiliation":"Argonne National Laboratory (US)","emailHash":"3883f9db68feb16e68792b1483a250cd","db_id":8426165,"person_id":8070408},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Saba","last_name":"Sehrish","fullName":"Sehrish, Saba","id":"8426166","affiliation":"Fermilab","emailHash":"a8ec3998f830c2bff1b73318d0f5f7d7","db_id":8426166,"person_id":8105162}],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","session":"Track 1: Computing Technology for Physics Research","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"19","db_id":5796495,"friendly_id":19,"title":"Seamless transition from TTree to RNTuple analysis with RDataFrame","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"22:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"22:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Theatre","room":"Theatre","note":{},"location":" Charles B.

The engine can process RNTuple datasets on a local machine, sequentially with one core or using implicit multithreading with multiple cores. Furthermore, RNTuple processing is also introduced in the distributed RDataFrame layer and benchmarked using SWAN, a web-based platform, to transparently offload analysis tasks to the CERN HTCondor pools. The new workflow is demonstrated using existing RDataFrame analyses on one or multiple nodes with no change in the API.

The ROOT team has developed a new I\/O subsystem, called RNTuple, that will replace TTree in the near future. RNTuple is designed to adopt various technological advancements that happened in the last decade and be more performant from both the computational and storage perspectives. On the other hand, RNTuple has limited\/streamlined data model support compared to TTree.\r\n\r\nThe ATLAS Event Data Model (EDM) must support functionality arising from the vast complexity of the underlying detector and the constraints of the computing model. It takes advantage of C++ (object oriented) language features that allow efficient processing of highly complex algorithms that produce physics objects from various different sub-detectors. To encapsulate this complexity needed for transient processing, ATLAS had introduced a separation between the transient and the persistent (T\/P) representations of the EDM. This approach simplified the adoption of TTree as the main event data format at the time.

Big data presents opportunities for groundbreaking scientific discoveries. However, managing this vast amount of data cost-effectively while facilitating efficient data analysis within a large-scale, multi-tiered storage architecture poses a significant challenge for the Scientific Data and Computing Center (SDCC).\r\nThe storage team is currently addressing optimization challenges related to data classification, placement, and migration in the existing multi-tier storage system. While users and administrators manually optimize storage by migrating data based on simple rules derived from human knowledge, decisions, and basic usage statistics, evaluating the placement of data in different storage classes with I\/O-intensive workloads remains a complex task.\r\nTo overcome the aforementioned challenge and address existing limitations, we have developed a precise data popularity prediction model utilizing state-of-the-art AI\/ML techniques. Additionally, we have designed a data placement policy engine based on data popularity, allowing us to migrate infrequently accessed data to more economical storage media, such as tape drives, while storing frequently accessed data on faster yet costlier storage media like HDD or SSD. This strategy optimally places data into the proper storage classes, maximizing storage capacity while minimizing data access latency for end users. This paper delves into the analysis of the data, demonstration patterns, tag files. Specifically, we detail the design and development of an accurate AI\/ML prediction model to forecast future data popularity, based on an analysis of access patterns, facilitating optimal data movement and placement. Additionally, we provide insights into the implementation of a policy engine and data placement tool to execute automated migration actions. Finally, the evaluation of different strategies is illustrated, including those involving AI\/ML models,etc.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2820349,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4924868,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796832\/attachments\/2820349\/4924868\/AI-based%20Data%20Popularity,%20Placement%20Optimization%20for%20a%20Tiered%20Storage%20architecture%20at%20BNL_SDCC%20Facility.pdf","title":"AI-based Data Popularity, Placement Optimization for a Tiered Storage architecture at BNL:SDCC Facility.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-14T18:48:04.478134+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"AI-based Data Popularity, Placement Optimization for a Tiered Storage architecture at BNL_SDCC Facility.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":1884592,"checksum":"38ebe13801d13608e28e88c6df5e7c91"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796832\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Qiulan","last_name":"Huang","fullName":"Huang, Qiulan","id":"8426716","affiliation":"Brookhaven National Laboratory (US)","emailHash":"79eec8fa2cf30e30bbc8ec86de7a4ea5","db_id":8426716,"person_id":8051847}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Qiulan","last_name":"Huang","fullName":"Huang, Qiulan","id":"8426716","affiliation":"Brookhaven National Laboratory (US)","emailHash":"79eec8fa2cf30e30bbc8ec86de7a4ea5","db_id":8426716,"person_id":8051847}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"James","last_name":"Leonardi","fullName":"Leonardi, James","id":"8426714","affiliation":"Brookhaven National Laboratory","emailHash":"db62b491393cdddded9eecdec9564d18","db_id":8426714,"person_id":8051849},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Vincent","last_name":"Garonne","fullName":"Garonne, Vincent","id":"8426715","affiliation":"Brookhaven National Laboratory","emailHash":"43c9c3347d67bd18b3cb551c2c324763","db_id":8426715,"person_id":8051848},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Shinjae","last_name":"Yoo","fullName":"Yoo, Shinjae","id":"8426713","affiliation":"Brookhaven National Laboratory","emailHash":"750904add08de6813a34934bc0e29324","db_id":8426713,"person_id":8051846}],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 2: Data Analysis - Algorithms and Tools","session":"Track 2: Data Analysis - Algorithms and Tools","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"37","db_id":5796875,"friendly_id":37,"title":"Implementing an emissions model for dual phase xenon TPCs with probabilistic programming","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-14","time":"21:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-14","time":"22:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Lecture Hall 2","room":"Lecture Hall 2","note":{},"location":" Charles B.

DALs enable physicists to use the same software to work with different experiment's data formats, without worrying about the low-level details or the software infrastructure available. DALs have gained popularity since the HEP Analysis Ecosystem Retreat in Amsterdam in 2017, where they were first seriously discussed as in a community setting. Since then, several languages and tools have adopted features from DALs, such as ADL, awkward, RDF, and func_adl. These languages and tools vary in how much they adhere to the declarative principle, and how they interact with imperative code. In this presentation, we will review this convergence and some of the common features and challenges of DALs, using examples from various languages and tools. We will also discuss recent developments allowing different languages access to custom experiment data formats. We will conclude by reflecting on the future directions of DALs and imperative analysis tools, and how they can improve their convergence, usefulness, and efficiency.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2820341,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4924902,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796855\/attachments\/2820341\/4924902\/2024-03%20-%20Evolution%20of%20Declarative%20Languages.pdf","title":"2024-03 - Evolution of Declarative Languages.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-14T19:39:30.542548+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"2024-03 - Evolution of Declarative Languages.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":3098456,"checksum":"9d4a56e9cb9fbb0e171bd8c1893be759"},{"_type":"attachment","id":4924901,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796855\/attachments\/2820341\/4924901\/2024-03%20-%20Evolution%20of%20Declarative%20Languages.pptx","title":"2024-03 - Evolution of Declarative Languages.pptx","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-14T19:39:15.742228+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"2024-03 - Evolution of Declarative Languages.pptx","content_type":"application\/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation","size":7716868,"checksum":"b4590de80e93ffc761f837ede567eff9"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796855\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Gordon","last_name":"Watts","fullName":"Watts, Gordon","id":"8426812","affiliation":"University of Washington (US)","emailHash":"53faef883b37fb4dc03d02269b5a4401","db_id":8426812,"person_id":8105319}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Gordon","last_name":"Watts","fullName":"Watts, Gordon","id":"8426812","affiliation":"University of Washington (US)","emailHash":"53faef883b37fb4dc03d02269b5a4401","db_id":8426812,"person_id":8105319}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 2: Data Analysis - Algorithms and Tools","session":"Track 2: Data Analysis - Algorithms and Tools","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"16","db_id":5796892,"friendly_id":16,"title":"Consistent multi-differential histogramming and summary statistics with YODA2","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-14","time":"20:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-14","time":"20:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Lecture Hall 2","room":"Lecture Hall 2","note":{},"location":" Charles B.

However, the power and compactness of partially aggregated, multi-dimensional summary statistics with a fundamental connection to differential and integral calculus make them formidable statistical objects. Expressing these concepts robustly and efficiently in high-dimensional parameter spaces is a non-trivial challenge, especially when the resulting library is meant to remain usable by scientists rather than software engineers.\r\n\r\nA decade after its initial release, the YODA statistical library has been redesigned from the ground, aiming to generalise its principles while addressing real-world usage requirements in the era of expanding computational power and vast datasets. We will summarise the core principles required for consistent generalised histogramming and outline some of the C++ metaprogramming techniques adopted to handle dimensionality relationships in the revamped YODA histogramming library. Used both in Rivet and Contur, YODA is a key component of physics data\u2013model comparison and statistical interpretation in collider physics.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2820031,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4924227,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796892\/attachments\/2820031\/4924227\/cg_yoda2_acat2024.pdf","title":"cg_yoda2_acat2024.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-14T13:45:53.157185+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"cg_yoda2_acat2024.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":660126,"checksum":"1b3be44cf03e39a267e67be77b23530f"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796892\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Christian","last_name":"Gutschow","fullName":"Gutschow, Christian","id":"8426911","affiliation":"UCL (UK)","emailHash":"962a9f22ecc86ae589b2805255963801","db_id":8426911,"person_id":8086029}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Andy","last_name":"Buckley","fullName":"Buckley, Andy","id":"8426908","affiliation":"University of Glasgow (GB)","emailHash":"5f89d3a5a44fc3b2af5748e880aacc7b","db_id":8426908,"person_id":8086062},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Christian","last_name":"Gutschow","fullName":"Gutschow, Christian","id":"8426911","affiliation":"UCL (UK)","emailHash":"962a9f22ecc86ae589b2805255963801","db_id":8426911,"person_id":8086029},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jamie","last_name":"Yellen","fullName":"Yellen, Jamie","id":"8426910","affiliation":"University of Glasgow","emailHash":"f8406a4771f9e4af77adebbfb58c9c56","db_id":8426910,"person_id":8086064},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Yoran","last_name":"Yeh","fullName":"Yeh, Yoran","id":"8426909","affiliation":"University College London (UK)","emailHash":"030e4f5b143416cc3f31cb84e0775950","db_id":8426909,"person_id":8086063}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 2: Data Analysis - Algorithms and Tools","session":"Track 2: Data Analysis - Algorithms and Tools","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"91","db_id":5796853,"friendly_id":91,"title":"Common Analysis Tools in CMS","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-14","time":"20:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-14","time":"20:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Lecture Hall 2","room":"Lecture Hall 2","note":{},"location":" Charles B.

To address this, the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) experiment is scheduled to commence data collection in late 2024, with the ambitious goal of determining the NMO at a 3-sigma confidence level within a span of 6 years. A key factor in achieving this is ensuring a high-quality energy resolution of positrons. However, the presence of residual C14 isotopes in the liquid scintillator introduces pile-up effects that can impact the positron energy resolution. Mitigating these pile-up effects requires the identification of pile-up events, which presents a significant challenge. The signal from C14 is considerably smaller compared to the positron signal, making its identification difficult. Additionally, the close event time and vertex between a positron and a C14 further compound the identification challenge.\r\n\r\nThis contribution focuses on the application of deep learning models for the identification of C14 pile-up events. It encompasses a range of models, including convolutional-based models and advanced transformer models. Through performance evaluation, the study showcases the robust capabilities of deep learning models in accurately and effectively identifying pile-up events.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2819496,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4923169,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796830\/attachments\/2819496\/4923169\/JUNO_ML_C14_20240228.pdf","title":"JUNO_ML_C14_20240228.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-14T03:56:41.224259+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"JUNO_ML_C14_20240228.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":2698340,"checksum":"470c0ad26ea3d1b628a6d7651333ad62"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796830\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Wenxing","last_name":"Fang","fullName":"Fang, Wenxing","id":"8426709","affiliation":"","emailHash":"0ba49dd7ed9971d06f903d4576945778","db_id":8426709,"person_id":8009767}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Wenxing","last_name":"Fang","fullName":"Fang, Wenxing","id":"8426709","affiliation":"","emailHash":"0ba49dd7ed9971d06f903d4576945778","db_id":8426709,"person_id":8009767}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Weidong","last_name":"Li","fullName":"Li, Weidong","id":"8426710","affiliation":"IHEP, Beijing","emailHash":"33bda03bc5a535d48779811313257d8b","db_id":8426710,"person_id":8009768},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Wuming","last_name":"Luo","fullName":"Luo, Wuming","id":"8426711","affiliation":"Institute of High Energy Physics, Chinese Academy of Science","emailHash":"baee919415016e04040d375ccc92b418","db_id":8426711,"person_id":8009766}],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 2: Data Analysis - Algorithms and Tools","session":"Track 2: Data Analysis - Algorithms and Tools","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"178","db_id":5796860,"friendly_id":178,"title":"Offline filter of data with abnormal high voltage at BESIII drift chamber","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-14","time":"19:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-14","time":"19:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Lecture Hall 2","room":"Lecture Hall 2","note":{},"location":" Charles B.

But it is not easy to keep the detector always running stably during data taking period in environment with high beam induced background. In the BESIII experiment, serious beam related background may cause instability of the high voltages in the drift chamber which is the innermost sub detector. This could result in the decrease of gain and wrong dE\/dx measurement. The relationship between the dE\/dx measurement and the changes in high voltages has been studied. To guarantee the data quality for the physics study, an offline filter algorithm has been developed to remove the events with abnormal high voltages of the drift chamber. After applying the event filter on the data set with serious high voltage instability, the events with wrong dE\/dx measurement were removed effectively.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2820249,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4924750,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796860\/attachments\/2820249\/4924750\/LinghuiWu_ACAT2024.pdf","title":"LinghuiWu_ACAT2024.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-14T16:50:06.611406+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"LinghuiWu_ACAT2024.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":1868666,"checksum":"81e2c3e635fa1dce18976bd77f97810f"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796860\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Linghui","last_name":"Wu","fullName":"Wu, Linghui","id":"8426833","affiliation":"Chinese Academy of Sciences (CN)","emailHash":"f6ab2e19a839c9955328271e0be5f22c","db_id":8426833,"person_id":8199117}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Linghui","last_name":"Wu","fullName":"Wu, Linghui","id":"8426833","affiliation":"Chinese Academy of Sciences (CN)","emailHash":"f6ab2e19a839c9955328271e0be5f22c","db_id":8426833,"person_id":8199117},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Zeheng","last_name":"Zhang","fullName":"Zhang, Zeheng","id":"8426834","affiliation":"Institute of High Energy Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences","emailHash":"bb1f48f45f6baafa1d85cbec328d40ed","db_id":8426834,"person_id":8199118}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Huaimin","last_name":"Liu","fullName":"Liu, Huaimin","id":"8426836","affiliation":"Institute of High Energy Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences","emailHash":"1fc8da3a9b1d3d60ab00398919b1e11f","db_id":8426836,"person_id":8199120},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Liangliang","last_name":"Wang","fullName":"Wang, Liangliang","id":"8426835","affiliation":"Institute of High Energy Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences","emailHash":"4f664f7c2221d5f8997e2fa77ea1ee4d","db_id":8426835,"person_id":8199119}],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 2: Data Analysis - Algorithms and Tools","session":"Track 2: Data Analysis - Algorithms and Tools","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"20","db_id":5796879,"friendly_id":20,"title":"An empirical performance-portability evaluation for Lorentz Vectors computations via SYCL","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-13","time":"22:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-13","time":"23:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Lecture Hall 2","room":"Lecture Hall 2","note":{},"location":" Charles B.

In particle physics, the relevant symmetries are permutations and the Lorentz group, and the best-performing networks are either custom-built Lorentz-equivariant architectures or more generic large transformer models. A major unanswered question is whether the high performance of Lorentz-equivariant architectures is in fact due to their equivariance. Here we report a study designed to isolate and investigate effects of equivariance on network performance. A particular equivariant model, PELICAN, has its symmetry broken down with no to minimal architectural changes via both explicit and implicit methods. Equivariance is broken explicitly by supplying model inputs that are equivariant under strict Lorentz subgroups, while it is broken implicitly by adding spurious particles which imply laboratory-frame geometry. We compare its performance on common benchmark tasks in the equivariant and non-equivariant regimes.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2819420,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4923041,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796873\/attachments\/2819420\/4923041\/PELICAN%20ACAT%202024.pdf","title":"PELICAN ACAT 2024.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-13T19:20:07.178186+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"PELICAN ACAT 2024.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":9556041,"checksum":"98f25a879864b0373bd4c4edbc5d82d3"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796873\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alexander","last_name":"Bogatskiy","fullName":"Bogatskiy, Alexander","id":"8426877","affiliation":"Flatiron Institute, Simons Foundation","emailHash":"0b54bd52af9e9604522f737ff6cb1736","db_id":8426877,"person_id":8165609},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Timothy","last_name":"Hoffman","fullName":"Hoffman, Timothy","id":"8426876","affiliation":"","emailHash":"f23036cbe6718b681863973b428e3881","db_id":8426876,"person_id":8165610}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alexander","last_name":"Bogatskiy","fullName":"Bogatskiy, Alexander","id":"8426877","affiliation":"Flatiron Institute, Simons Foundation","emailHash":"0b54bd52af9e9604522f737ff6cb1736","db_id":8426877,"person_id":8165609},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jan Tuzlic","last_name":"Offermann","fullName":"Offermann, Jan Tuzlic","id":"8426875","affiliation":"University of Chicago (US)","emailHash":"7d131e91d9b553ccaef00ecebe810eb1","db_id":8426875,"person_id":8165611},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Timothy","last_name":"Hoffman","fullName":"Hoffman, Timothy","id":"8426876","affiliation":"","emailHash":"f23036cbe6718b681863973b428e3881","db_id":8426876,"person_id":8165610}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 2: Data Analysis - Algorithms and Tools","session":"Track 2: Data Analysis - Algorithms and Tools","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"184","db_id":5796867,"friendly_id":184,"title":"Fast and Robust ML for uncovering BSM physics","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-13","time":"22:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-13","time":"22:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Lecture Hall 2","room":"Lecture Hall 2","note":{},"location":" Charles B.

The networks then provide estimates for the origin of the 2D track candidates in direction of the colliding beams (z-vertex), as well as their polar emission angles theta. Given the z-vertices of the neural tracks allows identifying events coming from the collision region (z ~ 0), and suppressing the overwhelming background from outside by a suitable cut d. Requiring |z| < d for at least one neural track in an event with two or more 2D candidates will set an L1 trigger. The networks also enable a minimum bias trigger, requiring a single 2D track candidate validated by a neural track with a momentum larger than 0.7 GeV in addition to the |z| condition. The momentum of the neural track is derived with the help of the polar angle theta.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2819300,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4923064,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796864\/attachments\/2819300\/4923064\/BelleIINeuroTrackTrigger_CK.pdf","title":"ACAT2024-NeuroTrackTrigger-Kiesling.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-13T20:42:55.374821+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"BelleIINeuroTrackTrigger_CK.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":8202258,"checksum":"3c17cffa66a0b3f6b1c094a356893171"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796864\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Christian","last_name":"Kiesling","fullName":"Kiesling, Christian","id":"8426851","affiliation":"Max Planck Institut f\u00fcr Physik (DE)","emailHash":"307c967e0b46bacf9ecf251580d43969","db_id":8426851,"person_id":8165585}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Christian","last_name":"Kiesling","fullName":"Kiesling, Christian","id":"8426851","affiliation":"Max Planck Institut f\u00fcr Physik (DE)","emailHash":"307c967e0b46bacf9ecf251580d43969","db_id":8426851,"person_id":8165585}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alex","last_name":"Lenz","fullName":"Lenz, Alex","id":"8426852","affiliation":"TUM (Inf)","emailHash":null,"db_id":8426852,"person_id":8165580},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Alois","last_name":"Knoll","fullName":"Knoll, Alois","id":"8426853","affiliation":"TUM (Inf)","emailHash":null,"db_id":8426853,"person_id":8165581},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Felix","last_name":"Meggendorfer","fullName":"Meggendorfer, Felix","id":"8426850","affiliation":"Max Planck Institut f\u00fcr Physik (DE)","emailHash":null,"db_id":8426850,"person_id":8165583},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"J\u00fcrgen","last_name":"Becker","fullName":"Becker, J\u00fcrgen","id":"8426849","affiliation":"KIT (ITIV)","emailHash":null,"db_id":8426849,"person_id":8165584},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Kai","last_name":"Unger","fullName":"Unger, Kai","id":"8426847","affiliation":"KIT (ITIV","emailHash":null,"db_id":8426847,"person_id":8165582},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Steffen","last_name":"B\u00e4hr","fullName":"B\u00e4hr, Steffen","id":"8426854","affiliation":"KIT (ITIV)","emailHash":null,"db_id":8426854,"person_id":8165578},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Tobias","last_name":"J\u00fclg","fullName":"J\u00fclg, Tobias","id":"8426848","affiliation":"TUM (Inf)","emailHash":null,"db_id":8426848,"person_id":8165579}],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 2: Data Analysis - Algorithms and Tools","session":"Track 2: Data Analysis - Algorithms and Tools","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"79","db_id":5796845,"friendly_id":79,"title":"Generic representations of jets at detector-level with self-supervised learning","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-13","time":"20:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-13","time":"21:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Lecture Hall 2","room":"Lecture Hall 2","note":{},"location":" Charles B.

Each model learns to encode jet features, resulting in a representation that is tailored to its specific task. But could the common elements underlying such tasks be combined in a single foundation model to extract features generically? To address this question, we explore self-supervised learning (SSL), inspired by its applications in the domains of computer vision and natural language processing. Besides offering a simpler and more resource-effective route when learning multiple tasks, SSL can be trained on unlabeled data, e.g. large sets of collision data. We demonstrate that a jet representation obtained through SSL can be readily fine-tuned for downstream tasks of jet kinematics prediction and jet classification. Compared to existing studies in this direction, we use a realistic full-coverage calorimeter simulation, leading to results that more faithfully reflect the prospects at real collider experiments.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2819372,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4922927,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796845\/attachments\/2819372\/4922927\/genericJetReps_acat2024_rieck.pdf","title":"genericJetReps_acat2024_rieck.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-13T17:01:05.102399+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"genericJetReps_acat2024_rieck.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":4255610,"checksum":"ffcdc8fa48918bb745b64a32046504d5"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796845\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"Rieck","fullName":"Rieck, Patrick","id":"8426777","affiliation":"New York University (US)","emailHash":"3772b7f7e8903049a26af770bcec1cd4","db_id":8426777,"person_id":8105231}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Dmitrii","last_name":"Kobylianskii","fullName":"Kobylianskii, Dmitrii","id":"8426771","affiliation":"Weizmann Institute of Science (IL)","emailHash":"6f7bf9e53314509dd90aaff745740284","db_id":8426771,"person_id":8105237},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Eilam","last_name":"Gross","fullName":"Gross, Eilam","id":"8426770","affiliation":"Weizmann Institute of Science (IL)","emailHash":"8b6ca1a781d10e395cf41fbb42fb4523","db_id":8426770,"person_id":8105233},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Etienne","last_name":"Dreyer","fullName":"Dreyer, Etienne","id":"8426774","affiliation":"Weizmann Institute of Science (IL)","emailHash":"711a456261dabae7a056f781eea01176","db_id":8426774,"person_id":8105236},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Garrett","last_name":"Merz","fullName":"Merz, Garrett","id":"8426773","affiliation":"","emailHash":"bd48b5ca9f1a41269da306b76fca91d1","db_id":8426773,"person_id":8105232},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Kyle Stuart","last_name":"Cranmer","fullName":"Cranmer, Kyle Stuart","id":"8426772","affiliation":"University of Wisconsin Madison (US)","emailHash":"5b217a44340c73d0ddfa1b01630d0a53","db_id":8426772,"person_id":8105234},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Nathalie","last_name":"Soybelman","fullName":"Soybelman, Nathalie","id":"8426776","affiliation":"Weizmann Institute of Science (IL)","emailHash":"ef5e6619c79cc7e7db3fa6cc004605f3","db_id":8426776,"person_id":8105238},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Nilotpal","last_name":"Kakati","fullName":"Kakati, Nilotpal","id":"8426775","affiliation":"Weizmann Institute of Science (IL)","emailHash":"02c3f596b609c322befe843c472e5420","db_id":8426775,"person_id":8105235},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"Rieck","fullName":"Rieck, Patrick","id":"8426777","affiliation":"New York University (US)","emailHash":"3772b7f7e8903049a26af770bcec1cd4","db_id":8426777,"person_id":8105231}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 2: Data Analysis - Algorithms and Tools","session":"Track 2: Data Analysis - Algorithms and Tools","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"52","db_id":5796843,"friendly_id":52,"title":"Machine learning-based particle identification of atmospheric neutrinos in JUNO","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-13","time":"20:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-13","time":"20:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Lecture Hall 2","room":"Lecture Hall 2","note":{},"location":" Charles B.

Moreover, high-energy (GeV-level) atmospheric neutrino measurements could also improve its sensitivity to mass ordering via matter effects on oscillations, which depend on the capability to identify electron (anti-)neutrinos and muon (anti-)neutrinos against each other and against neutral current background, as well as to identify neutrinos against antineutrinos. However, this particle identification task has never been attempted in large homogeneous liquid scintillator detectors like JUNO.\r\nThis contribution presents a machine learning approach for the particle identification of atmospheric neutrinos in JUNO. In this method, several features relevant to event topology are extracted from PMT waveforms and used as inputs to the machine learning models. Moreover, the features from captured neutrons could also provide the capability of neutrinos versus anti-neutrinos identification. Two independent strategies are developed to utilize neutron information and to combine these two types of inputs information in different machine learning models. Preliminary results based on Monte Carlo simulations show promising potential for this approach.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2816021,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4916036,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796843\/attachments\/2816021\/4916036\/JUNO_atmo_PID_ACAT.pdf","title":"JUNO_atmo_PID_ACAT.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-08T13:22:34.555414+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"JUNO_atmo_PID_ACAT.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":3302138,"checksum":"e9944b0bc28bc758988e61455c50267e"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796843\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jiaxi","last_name":"Liu","fullName":"Liu, Jiaxi","id":"8426759","affiliation":"","emailHash":"012c2a108117d39d87d43c7e2f31ee1e","db_id":8426759,"person_id":8103943}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Fanrui","last_name":"Zeng","fullName":"Zeng, Fanrui","id":"8426761","affiliation":"China, Shandong University","emailHash":"1223e4d862b501b980af1a83cc5d04b7","db_id":8426761,"person_id":8103942},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Hongyue","last_name":"Duyang","fullName":"Duyang, Hongyue","id":"8426760","affiliation":"Shandong University","emailHash":"752393169f791671b01ebf6ab8ec64bf","db_id":8426760,"person_id":8103940},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jiaxi","last_name":"Liu","fullName":"Liu, Jiaxi","id":"8426759","affiliation":"","emailHash":"012c2a108117d39d87d43c7e2f31ee1e","db_id":8426759,"person_id":8103943},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Teng","last_name":"LI","fullName":"LI, Teng","id":"8426757","affiliation":"Shandong University, CN","emailHash":"c6c302428ff4c73ceb3723fea91da1c6","db_id":8426757,"person_id":8103938},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Wing Yan","last_name":"Ma","fullName":"Ma, Wing Yan","id":"8426756","affiliation":"SDU","emailHash":"b137b71b50d87ae48a85ccba48943ff6","db_id":8426756,"person_id":8105276},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Wuming","last_name":"Luo","fullName":"Luo, Wuming","id":"8426762","affiliation":"Institute of High Energy Physics, Chinese Academy of Science","emailHash":"baee919415016e04040d375ccc92b418","db_id":8426762,"person_id":8009766},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Xinhai","last_name":"He","fullName":"He, Xinhai","id":"8426758","affiliation":"The Institute of High Energy Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences","emailHash":"9284b1847eafe405edbe4f4b0ac1d1bc","db_id":8426758,"person_id":8103941}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 2: Data Analysis - Algorithms and Tools","session":"Track 2: Data Analysis - Algorithms and Tools","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"80","db_id":5796846,"friendly_id":80,"title":"Boosting statistical anomaly detection via multiple test with NPLM","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-13","time":"20:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-13","time":"20:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Lecture Hall 2","room":"Lecture Hall 2","note":{},"location":" Charles B.

One of the most crucial and still unaddressed challenges of these applications is how to optimize the chances of detecting unexpected anomalies when prior knowledge about the nature of the latter is not available.\r\nIn this presentation we show how to exploit multiple tests to improve sensitivity to rare anomalies of different nature. We focus on a kernel methods based implementation of the NPLM algorithm, a signal-agnostic goodness of fit test based on a ML approximation of the likelihood ratio test [[1][1], [2][2]]. \r\nFirst, we show how performing multiple tests with different model configurations on the same data allows us to work around the problem of hyperparameters tuning, improving the algorithm\u2019s chance of discovery at the same time. Second, we show how multiple samples of streamed data can be optimally exploited to increase sensitivity to rare signals.\r\nThe presented findings offer the ability to perform fast, efficient, and sensitivity-enhanced applications of the NPLM algorithm to a larger and potentially more inclusive set of data, both offline and quasi-online.\r\nWith low-dimensional problems, we show this tool acts as a powerful diagnostic and compression algorithm. Furthermore, we find the agnostic nature of the strategy becomes especially relevant when the input data representation results from unsupervised ML algorithms, whose response to anomalies cannot be predicted.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1140\/epjc\/s10052-022-10830-y\r\n  [2]: https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2305.14137","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2818560,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4921304,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796846\/attachments\/2818560\/4921304\/ACAT24_Grosso.pdf","title":"ACAT24_Grosso.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-13T18:37:26.358255+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"ACAT24_Grosso.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":4201384,"checksum":"2dc5d5c228d6fa15adfcbc4e2bde5b2c"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796846\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Gaia","last_name":"Grosso","fullName":"Grosso, Gaia","id":"8426778","affiliation":"IAIFI, MIT","emailHash":"be53b20fc5091b01566d6bbfa2fcdf0d","db_id":8426778,"person_id":8105255}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Gaia","last_name":"Grosso","fullName":"Grosso, Gaia","id":"8426778","affiliation":"IAIFI, MIT","emailHash":"be53b20fc5091b01566d6bbfa2fcdf0d","db_id":8426778,"person_id":8105255},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Marco","last_name":"Letizia","fullName":"Letizia, Marco","id":"8426779","affiliation":"","emailHash":"9baec9bebe8baeed921976752de3defc","db_id":8426779,"person_id":8105256},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Philip Coleman","last_name":"Harris","fullName":"Harris, Philip Coleman","id":"8426780","affiliation":"Massachusetts Inst. of Technology (US)","emailHash":"ead7779e57554accb5b6f48bef3872b4","db_id":8426780,"person_id":8105186}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 2: Data Analysis - Algorithms and Tools","session":"Track 2: Data Analysis - Algorithms and Tools","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"126","db_id":5796872,"friendly_id":126,"title":"Reducing Systematic Differences between Data and Simulation with Generative Models","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-13","time":"19:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-13","time":"20:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Lecture Hall 2","room":"Lecture Hall 2","note":{},"location":" Charles B.

We first demonstrate using neural networks to emulate specific hadronization when trained using the inputs and outputs of classical methods. A protocol is then developed to fit a deep generative hadronization model in a realistic setting, where we only have access to a set of hadrons in data. Finally, we build a deep generative hadronization model that includes both kinematic (continuous) and flavor (discrete) degrees of freedom. Our approach is based on Generative Adversarial Networks and we show the performance within the context of the cluster model within the Herwig event generator.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2819104,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4922411,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796837\/attachments\/2819104\/4922411\/hadml_ACAT2024.pdf","title":"hadml_ACAT2024.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-13T13:52:30.060112+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"hadml_ACAT2024.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":4530070,"checksum":"f7916bd15e7e6b45667227ae78986e26"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796837\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jay","last_name":"Chan","fullName":"Chan, Jay","id":"8426730","affiliation":"Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The detector's spatial resolution, specifically the calorimeter's granularity, plays a crucial role in determining the quality of the particle reconstruction. It also sets the upper limit for the algorithm's theoretical capabilities. Super-resolution techniques can be explored as a promising solution to address the limitations imposed by the detector's spatial resolution. Super-resolution refers to enhancing the resolution of low-resolution images to obtain higher-resolution versions. In the specific case of calorimeter data, which is characterized by sparsity and non-homogeneity, representing it using graphs provides the most faithful representation. Building upon this idea, we propose a diffusion model for graph super-resolution that uses a transformer-based de-noising network to enhance the resolution of calorimeter data. Notably, this study represents the first instance of applying graph super-resolution with diffusion. The low-resolution image, corresponding to recorded detector data, is also subject to noise from various sources. As an added benefit, the proposed model aims to remove these noise artifacts, further contributing to improved particle reconstruction.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2818386,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4920917,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796862\/attachments\/2818386\/4920917\/SupRes_nilotpal.pdf","title":"SupRes_nilotpal.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-12T16:09:28.415179+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"SupRes_nilotpal.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":5628347,"checksum":"1be1a54385474810040d8f448e990d9e"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796862\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Nilotpal","last_name":"Kakati","fullName":"Kakati, Nilotpal","id":"8426843","affiliation":"Weizmann Institute of Science (IL)","emailHash":"02c3f596b609c322befe843c472e5420","db_id":8426843,"person_id":8105235}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Nilotpal","last_name":"Kakati","fullName":"Kakati, Nilotpal","id":"8426843","affiliation":"Weizmann Institute of Science (IL)","emailHash":"02c3f596b609c322befe843c472e5420","db_id":8426843,"person_id":8105235}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Eilam","last_name":"Gross","fullName":"Gross, Eilam","id":"8426844","affiliation":"Weizmann Institute of Science (IL)","emailHash":"8b6ca1a781d10e395cf41fbb42fb4523","db_id":8426844,"person_id":8105233},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Etienne","last_name":"Dreyer","fullName":"Dreyer, Etienne","id":"8426845","affiliation":"Weizmann Institute of Science (IL)","emailHash":"711a456261dabae7a056f781eea01176","db_id":8426845,"person_id":8105236}],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 2: Data Analysis - Algorithms and Tools","session":"Track 2: Data Analysis - Algorithms and Tools","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"94","db_id":5796854,"friendly_id":94,"title":"Beyond Language: Foundation Models for Collider Physics Data","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-12","time":"17:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-12","time":"17:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Lecture Hall 2","room":"Lecture Hall 2","note":{},"location":" Charles B.

The models, often referred to as foundation models, aim, through self-supervision, to simplify complex tasks by extracting the most salient features of the data through a careful choice of pre-training strategy. When done effectively, these models can lead to world-leading algorithm performance on a large number of tasks. We present a re-simulation strategy for a model pretraining (R3SL) and show that this strategy applied to quark and gluon jets at the Large Hadron Collider can be used to create a foundation model for hadronically decaying objects. We show R3SL creates a feature space insensitive to the parton shower model uncertainties while retaining the core features of quark and gluon jets. On downstream tasks utilizing the pre-trained feature space, we demonstrate our method achieves comparable, if not better, tagging performance to established benchmarks for jet tagging in Higgs to bottom quarks, but with greatly reduced uncertainties. The algorithm presents a crucial step towards more robust searches for new physics involving particle jets and paves the way for the development of foundation models at the Large Hadron Collider.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2818334,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4920816,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796850\/attachments\/2818334\/4920816\/PCH_Foundation_11_3.pdf","title":"PCH_Foundation_11_3.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-12T15:26:00.932198+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"PCH_Foundation_11_3.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":68317596,"checksum":"597c01c5a1072d6cecdfb9b97cfba94f"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796850\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Philip Coleman","last_name":"Harris","fullName":"Harris, Philip Coleman","id":"8426796","affiliation":"Massachusetts Inst. of Technology (US)","emailHash":"ead7779e57554accb5b6f48bef3872b4","db_id":8426796,"person_id":8105186}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Benedikt","last_name":"Maier","fullName":"Maier, Benedikt","id":"8426798","affiliation":"KIT - Karlsruhe Institute of  Technology (DE)","emailHash":"2a449b1eb31af8bc4d76113d214b6466","db_id":8426798,"person_id":8105348},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jeffrey","last_name":"Krupa","fullName":"Krupa, Jeffrey","id":"8426800","affiliation":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","emailHash":"7ebcd9280b450c51f72fb150d9e01f30","db_id":8426800,"person_id":8105349},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Maurizio","last_name":"Pierini","fullName":"Pierini, Maurizio","id":"8426799","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"9195707f9eb80b942f062bdf3f8e0887","db_id":8426799,"person_id":8105347},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Kagan","fullName":"Kagan, Michael","id":"8426797","affiliation":"SLAC National Accelerator  Laboratory (US)","emailHash":"9bf16d7b86ef47688945da411e1cbafe","db_id":8426797,"person_id":8105350},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Philip Coleman","last_name":"Harris","fullName":"Harris, Philip Coleman","id":"8426796","affiliation":"Massachusetts Inst. of Technology (US)","emailHash":"ead7779e57554accb5b6f48bef3872b4","db_id":8426796,"person_id":8105186}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 2: Data Analysis - Algorithms and Tools","session":"Track 2: Data Analysis - Algorithms and Tools","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"86","db_id":5796878,"friendly_id":86,"title":"Track reconstruction for future colliders with quantum algorithms","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"22:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"23:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Lecture Hall 2","room":"Lecture Hall 2","note":{},"location":" Charles B.

Many recent developments have explored new tracking algorithms in order to improve scalability in preparation of the HL-LHC. In particular, Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach due to the graph nature of particle tracks. Most of these GNN-based methods implement a three-step algorithm, including graph construction, edge classification, and graph segmentation. Others perform object condensation (OC) after the graph construction stage followed by a clustering of the detector hits. In this presentation, we consider a one-shot OC approach which reconstructs particle tracks directly from a set of hits (point cloud) by recursively applying Graph Attention Networks with an evolutional graph structure. This approach simplifies the procedure compared to the three-step approaches and also allows to further regress the hit properties.

The primary goal of the experiment is to determine the neutrino mass ordering (NMO) and measure other neutrino oscillation parameters to sub-percent precision. Atmospheric neutrinos are sensitive to NMO via matter effects and can improve JUNO\u2019s total sensitivity in a joint analysis with reactor neutrinos; Atmospheric muons contribute to one of the most important background sources to neutrino signals. Good capability of reconstructing atmospheric neutrinos and muons in JUNO is crucial for its physics goal.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, we present a novel multi-purpose reconstruction method for atmospheric neutrinos, muons and other physics events at similar energies (few GeV to tens of GeV) by combining PMT waveform analysis and machine learning techniques.  Multiple machine learning approaches, including planer, spherical, and 3-dimensional models, as well as other novel techniques in improving reconstruction precision, are discussed and compared. We show the performance of reconstructing atmospheric neutrino\u2019s directionality and energy using Monte-Carlo simulations, and demonstrate that this method can achieve unprecedented reconstruction precision for multiple physics quantities and fulfils the needs of JUNO. This method also has the potential to be applied to other liquid scintillator detectors.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2816998,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4918094,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796849\/attachments\/2816998\/4918094\/ACAT2024v3.pdf","title":"ACAT2024-RecoNeutrinoJUNO-Ma.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-11T16:22:14.354867+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"ACAT2024v3.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":12114485,"checksum":"219cd205d67d84fd8e3e3d9caf71d6e1"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796849\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Wing Yan","last_name":"Ma","fullName":"Ma, Wing Yan","id":"8426790","affiliation":"SDU","emailHash":"b137b71b50d87ae48a85ccba48943ff6","db_id":8426790,"person_id":8105276}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Wing Yan","last_name":"Ma","fullName":"Ma, Wing Yan","id":"8426790","affiliation":"SDU","emailHash":"b137b71b50d87ae48a85ccba48943ff6","db_id":8426790,"person_id":8105276}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Fanrui","last_name":"Zeng","fullName":"Zeng, Fanrui","id":"8426791","affiliation":"China, Shandong University","emailHash":"1223e4d862b501b980af1a83cc5d04b7","db_id":8426791,"person_id":8103942},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Hongyue","last_name":"Duyang","fullName":"Duyang, Hongyue","id":"8426792","affiliation":"Shandong University","emailHash":"752393169f791671b01ebf6ab8ec64bf","db_id":8426792,"person_id":8103940},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Jiaxi","last_name":"Liu","fullName":"Liu, Jiaxi","id":"8426795","affiliation":"","emailHash":"012c2a108117d39d87d43c7e2f31ee1e","db_id":8426795,"person_id":8103943},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Teng","last_name":"LI","fullName":"LI, Teng","id":"8426794","affiliation":"Shandong University, CN","emailHash":"c6c302428ff4c73ceb3723fea91da1c6","db_id":8426794,"person_id":8103938},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Wuming","last_name":"Luo","fullName":"Luo, Wuming","id":"8426793","affiliation":"Institute of High Energy Physics, Chinese Academy of Science","emailHash":"baee919415016e04040d375ccc92b418","db_id":8426793,"person_id":8009766},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Xinhai","last_name":"He","fullName":"He, Xinhai","id":"8426789","affiliation":"The Institute of High Energy Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences","emailHash":"9284b1847eafe405edbe4f4b0ac1d1bc","db_id":8426789,"person_id":8103941}],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 2: Data Analysis - Algorithms and Tools","session":"Track 2: Data Analysis - Algorithms and Tools","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"110","db_id":5796874,"friendly_id":110,"title":"Wire-Cell: A High Quality Automated LArTPC Reconstruction for Neutrino Experiments","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"21:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"22:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Lecture Hall 2","room":"Lecture Hall 2","note":{},"location":" Charles B.

It provides the core detector technology for many current and next-generation large-scale neutrino experiments, such as DUNE and the SBN program. In neutrino experiments, LArTPC faces numerous challenges in both hardware and software to achieve optimum performance. On the software side, the main challenge is two-fold. First, there is a need for further accumulation of deep domain knowledge. Second, the event's degree of freedom is high due to its large scale and the uncertainties in initial neutrino-argon interactions.\r\n\r\nTo address the reconstruction challenge from LArTPC detectors, we developed a comprehensive software suite and a set of algorithms, collectively termed 'Wire-Cell.' This innovative system is founded on the concept of topographical 3D reconstruction using multiple 2D LArTPC images. Key to enabling this 3D reconstruction was an extensive study of detector signal formation and signal processing, providing crucial insights. Building on the outcomes of the 3D reconstruction, we crafted a high-quality automated neutrino reconstruction chain. This chain integrates both traditional and machine-learning algorithms. The effectiveness of the Wire-Cell reconstruction approach is validated with real experiment data, specifically in the context of MicroBooNE physics analyses.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we delve into the Wire-Cell LArTPC reconstruction paradigm, with a particular emphasis on the underlying algorithms. Our focus is to demonstrate how Wire-Cell not only addresses but also advances the field of LArTPC detector data interpretation.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2816508,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4918939,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796874\/attachments\/2816508\/4918939\/ACAT2024-wirecell-Yu.pdf","title":"ACAT2024-wirecell-Yu.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-11T19:45:10.510968+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"ACAT2024-wirecell-Yu.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":9252029,"checksum":"4b0f9f94d2a389baf844d8e28c0a1b75"},{"_type":"attachment","id":4918940,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796874\/attachments\/2816508\/4918940\/ACAT2024-wirecell-Yu.pptx","title":"ACAT2024-wirecell-Yu.pptx","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-11T19:45:12.089619+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"ACAT2024-wirecell-Yu.pptx","content_type":"application\/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation","size":26739846,"checksum":"616ab11cd96c898882ab9a2df3d6be02"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796874\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Haiwang","last_name":"Yu","fullName":"Yu, Haiwang","id":"8426878","affiliation":"","emailHash":"10748272f64f34cc834eb28f69628c3d","db_id":8426878,"person_id":8096527}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Haiwang","last_name":"Yu","fullName":"Yu, Haiwang","id":"8426878","affiliation":"","emailHash":"10748272f64f34cc834eb28f69628c3d","db_id":8426878,"person_id":8096527}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 2: Data Analysis - Algorithms and Tools","session":"Track 2: Data Analysis - Algorithms and Tools","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"163","db_id":5796870,"friendly_id":163,"title":"Tracking and vertexing downstream the LHCb magnet at the first stage of the trigger.","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"20:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"21:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Lecture Hall 2","room":"Lecture Hall 2","note":{},"location":" Charles B.

These features can then be fine-tuned for downstream classification tasks such as Top Tagging and $H \\rightarrow b \\bar{b}$ vs QCD, with minimal additional effort.\r\n\r\nThe research explores several key questions: the scalability of dataset size in pretraining, the comparative analysis of contrastive learning techniques like SimCLR and VICReg, the effectiveness of the ParticleTransformer architecture over conventional transformer models, and whether self-supervised pretraining on unlabeled data combined with fine-tuning on labeled simulation aids the model in adapting to the data domain. \r\n\r\nBy investigating these aspects, we aim to provide insights into the impact of dataset size on pre-training, evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of various contrastive learning methods, assess the architectural advantages of ParticleTransformer in jet classification, and facilitate the domain adaptation of machine learning algorithms for enhanced applicability in particle physics. \r\n\r\nThis study significantly contributes to the field of machine learning in particle physics, demonstrating the immense potential of self-supervised learning in utilizing real, unlabeled data for more efficient and accurate jet classification.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2816510,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4918734,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796859\/attachments\/2816510\/4918734\/ACAT2024-SSL-Zhao.pdf","title":"ACAT2024-SSL-Zhao.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-11T16:01:58.364128+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"ACAT2024-SSL-Zhao.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":13417908,"checksum":"bd03c2f7f34ae92451902a66a61bd4a3"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796859\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Zihan","last_name":"Zhao","fullName":"Zhao, Zihan","id":"8426830","affiliation":"Univ. of California San Diego (US)","emailHash":"64a15d4a67dd5f2b82552d039a712fc8","db_id":8426830,"person_id":8165404}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Zihan","last_name":"Zhao","fullName":"Zhao, Zihan","id":"8426830","affiliation":"Univ. of California San Diego (US)","emailHash":"64a15d4a67dd5f2b82552d039a712fc8","db_id":8426830,"person_id":8165404}],"coauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Carlos","last_name":"Pareja","fullName":"Pareja, Carlos","id":"8426829","affiliation":"University of California, San Diego","emailHash":"e4109b23dfebd3d9a9c6a7367159d2b5","db_id":8426829,"person_id":8165402},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Farouk","last_name":"Mokhtar","fullName":"Mokhtar, Farouk","id":"8426828","affiliation":"Univ. of California San Diego (US)","emailHash":"7bda076b0fc0228b6ff5968a6e8434b7","db_id":8426828,"person_id":8165401},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Haoyang","last_name":"Li","fullName":"Li, Haoyang","id":"8528489","affiliation":"Univ. of California San Diego (US)","emailHash":"c4d3589c74be2a751d68393e579b9c94","db_id":8528489,"person_id":8312213},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Javier Mauricio","last_name":"Duarte","fullName":"Duarte, Javier Mauricio","id":"8426832","affiliation":"Univ. of California San Diego (US)","emailHash":"72666942e76ab6c2541c29b3356107e5","db_id":8426832,"person_id":8165403},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Raghav","last_name":"Kansal","fullName":"Kansal, Raghav","id":"8426831","affiliation":"Univ. of California San Diego (US)","emailHash":"784431c680ad487b250868b7035785d8","db_id":8426831,"person_id":8165405}],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 2: Data Analysis - Algorithms and Tools","session":"Track 2: Data Analysis - Algorithms and Tools","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"43","db_id":5796841,"friendly_id":43,"title":"Line Segment Tracking: Improving the Phase 2 CMS High Level Trigger Tracking with a Novel, Hardware-Agnostic Pattern Recognition Algorithm","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"19:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-11","time":"20:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Lecture Hall 2","room":"Lecture Hall 2","note":{},"location":" Charles B. Wang Center, Stony Brook University ","type":"Oral","description":"Charged particle reconstruction is one the most computationally heavy components of the full event reconstruction of Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments. Looking to the future, projections for the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) indicate a superlinear growth for required computing resources for single-threaded CPU algorithms that surpass the computing resources that are expected to be available. The combination of these facts creates the need for efficient and computationally performant pattern recognition algorithms that will be able to run in parallel and possibly on other hardware, such as GPUs, given that these become more and more available in LHC experiment and high-performance computing centres. Line Segment Tracking (LST) is a novel such algorithm which has been developed to be fully parallelizable and hardware agnostic. The latter is achieved through the usage of the Alpaka library. The LST algorithm has been tested with the CMS central software as an external package and has been used in the context of the CMS HL-LHC High Level Trigger (HLT). When employing LST for pattern recognition in the HLT tracking, the physics and timing performances are shown to improve with respect to the ones utilizing the current pattern recognition algorithms. The latest results on the usage of the LST algorithm within the CMS HL-LHC HLT are presented, along with prospects for further improvements of the algorithm and its CMS central software integration.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2817037,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4918908,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796841\/attachments\/2817037\/4918908\/ACAT2024-LSTinPhase2HLT-Vourliotis.pdf","title":"ACAT2024-LSTinPhase2HLT-Vourliotis.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-11T18:19:27.106209+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"ACAT2024-LSTinPhase2HLT-Vourliotis.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":1147954,"checksum":"25b5c55484524116a28b3db6dd1e0927"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796841\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Manos","last_name":"Vourliotis","fullName":"Vourliotis,

Wang Center, Stony Brook University ","type":"Oral","description":"Based on the tracking experience at LHC, the project, A Common Tracking Software (ACTS),  aims to provide an open-source experiment-independent and framework-independent software designed for modern computing architectures. It provides a set of high-level performant track reconstruction tools which are agnostic to the details of the detection technologies and magnetic field configuration, and tested for strict thread-safety to support multi-threaded event processing. \r\n\r\nACTS has been used as a tracking toolkit at experiments such as ATLAS, sPHENIX, FASER, ALICE etc. and has shown very promising tracking performance in terms of both physics performance and time performance. So far, the applications of ACTS are mainly focusing on silicon-based tracking systems. However, its application for gaseous tracking detectors, for example, drift chamber, is very limited. Therefore, an example gaseous tracking detector is still lacking in ACTS.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, we will introduce the progress recently we have made in extending the current version of ACTS to support tracking with the gaseous detector like uRWell-based detector and drift chamber. The detailed implementation will be described. The application of this implementation to two future electron-positron collision experiments i.e. Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) and Super Tau Charm Factory (STCF) will be presented.  In addition, the efforts of adding an open-access drift chamber to the Open Data Detector will also be introduced to facilitate the development of common tracking algorithms in the future.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2816922,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4917946,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796851\/attachments\/2816922\/4917946\/ACAT2024_talk_Tao.pdf","title":"ACAT2024_talk_Tao.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-11T12:29:59.379600+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"ACAT2024_talk_Tao.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":3212272,"checksum":"e0625a8d24445f20f2d9dedf8436e6ba"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5796851\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Tao","last_name":"Lin","fullName":"Lin, Tao","id":"8426802","affiliation":"","emailHash":"a696972a0dc29e70843f619695acb1e9","db_id":8426802,"person_id":8108098}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Xiaocong","last_name":"Ai","fullName":"Ai, Xiaocong","id":"8426803","affiliation":"Zhengzhou University","emailHash":"fccbcefc95c628c3f359c2c4ae2b8287","db_id":8426803,"person_id":8108096},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Xingtao","last_name":"Huang","fullName":"Huang, Xingtao","id":"8426804","affiliation":"","emailHash":"e1e2a24dff8c78d2c078091f397fc033","db_id":8426804,"person_id":8108097},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Weidong","last_name":"Li","fullName":"Li, Weidong","id":"8426801","affiliation":"IHEP, Beijing","emailHash":"33bda03bc5a535d48779811313257d8b","db_id":8426801,"person_id":8009768},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Tao","last_name":"Lin","fullName":"Lin, Tao","id":"8426802","affiliation":"","emailHash":"a696972a0dc29e70843f619695acb1e9","db_id":8426802,"person_id":8108098}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 2: Data Analysis - Algorithms and Tools","session":"Track 2: Data Analysis - Algorithms and Tools","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"133","db_id":5776099,"friendly_id":133,"title":"Long-term high-volume data storage in ceramic","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-14","time":"14:00:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-14","time":"14:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":30,"roomFullname":"Theatre","room":"Theatre","note":{},"location":" Charles B.

Wang Center, Stony Brook University ","type":"Oral","description":"In atmospheric physics, particle-resolved direct numerical simulation (PR-DNS) models constitute an important tool to study aerosol-cloud-turbulence interactions which are central to the prediction of weather and climate . They resolve the smallest turbulent eddies as well as track the development and motion of individual particles [1,2]. PR-DNS is expected to complement experimental and observational facilities to further our understanding of the cloud dynamics. With a sufficient computational speed and scale, it can also be part of the digital twin to the experimental facilities such as the cloud chambers [2,3]. The original version of PR-DNS does not scale well on multi-core CPUs, thereby limiting the scale it can simulate. There is therefore a great need to accelerate the PR-DNS solver with tools from traditional high performance computing (HPC) as well as replacing computationally expensive modules with machine learning models. In this study, we exploit the potential of Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) [4] learning to yield fast and accurate surrogate models for the velocity and vorticity fields. We have investigated two classes of FNO \u2013  2D FNO which has two spatial dimensions with a recurrent structure in time and 3D FNO with two spatial and one temporal dimensions. We discuss results from numerical experiments designed to assess the performance of these architectures as well as their suitability for capturing the behavior of relevant dynamical systems.\r\n\r\n[1] Zheng Gao et al.

The technique is based on an improved parton-level event file format with efficient scalable data handling.

We start with an autogenerated hardware-agnostic Monte Carlo generator, which is parallelized in the event axis. This allow us to take advantage of the parallelizable nature of Monte Carlo integrals even if we do not have control of the hardware in which the computation will run (i.e., an external cluster). The generic nature of such an implementation can introduce spurious bottlenecks or overheads. Fortunately, said bottlenecks are usually restricted to a subset of operations and not to the whole vectorized program. By identifying the more critical parts of the calculation one can get very efficient code and at the same time minimize the amount of hardware-specific code that needs to be written. We show benchmarks demonstrating how simply reducing the memory footprint of the calculation can increase the performance of a 2\u21924 process. Finally, we present summary results about the performance achieved so far for PDF query on GPU and Monte Carlo integration.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2817459,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4919063,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5792178\/attachments\/2817459\/4919063\/flow_carrazza_acat24.pdf","title":"flow_carrazza_acat24.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-12T03:06:03.100756+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"flow_carrazza_acat24.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":4387563,"checksum":"3aef786d52b38c809d9af0fe449b3057"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5792178\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Stefano","last_name":"Carrazza","fullName":"Carrazza, Stefano","id":"8418748","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"84b1b2e8c091d096ffd7c2cec7636bc1","db_id":8418748,"person_id":8050149}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Juan M.","last_name":"Cruz Martinez","fullName":"Cruz Martinez, Juan M.","id":"8418747","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"ceda00951a15cef6eed1f5aca6be3954","db_id":8418747,"person_id":8050148},{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Stefano","last_name":"Carrazza","fullName":"Carrazza, Stefano","id":"8418748","affiliation":"CERN","emailHash":"84b1b2e8c091d096ffd7c2cec7636bc1","db_id":8418748,"person_id":8050149}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 3: Computations in Theoretical Physics: Techniques and Methods","session":"Track 3: Computations in Theoretical Physics: Techniques and Methods","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"97","db_id":5792181,"friendly_id":97,"title":"McMule -- a Monte Carlo generator for low energy processes","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-14","time":"19:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-14","time":"20:10:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Lecture Hall 1","room":"Lecture Hall 1","note":{},"location":" Charles B.

The results for the Feynman diagrams without lepton loops were presented by the author in 2018-2019. The remaining part of the diagrams will be presented here.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty is that known universal methods require enormous amount of computer resources to obtain the value. Author's method of reduction to finite integrals will be briefly explained as well as a specially developed Monte Carlo integration method.\r\n \r\nThe results are split into 95 gauge-invariant classes. Such a detailzation is provided for the first time and is useful for independent checking and theoretical investigations.","folders":[{"_type":"folder","id":2820356,"title":null,"description":"","attachments":[{"_type":"attachment","id":4924899,"download_url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5792180\/attachments\/2820356\/4924899\/volkov_acat_2024.pdf","title":"volkov_acat_2024.pdf","description":"","modified_dt":"2024-03-14T19:35:16.212538+00:00","type":"file","is_protected":false,"filename":"volkov_acat_2024.pdf","content_type":"application\/pdf","size":790936,"checksum":"10eaa9cafbdf4cbf42c8206a005cc1f6"}],"default_folder":true,"is_protected":false}],"url":"https:\/\/indico.cern.ch\/event\/1330797\/contributions\/5792180\/","material":[],"speakers":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sergey","last_name":"Volkov","fullName":"Volkov, Sergey","id":"8418753","affiliation":"","emailHash":"4ae1cf2d3aac318de75d0d0cdaff50a3","db_id":8418753,"person_id":8059057}],"primaryauthors":[{"_type":"ContributionParticipation","_fossil":"contributionParticipationMetadata","first_name":"Sergey","last_name":"Volkov","fullName":"Volkov, Sergey","id":"8418753","affiliation":"","emailHash":"4ae1cf2d3aac318de75d0d0cdaff50a3","db_id":8418753,"person_id":8059057}],"coauthors":[],"keywords":[],"track":"Track 3: Computations in Theoretical Physics: Techniques and Methods","session":"Track 3: Computations in Theoretical Physics: Techniques and Methods","references":[],"board_number":"","code":""},{"_type":"Contribution","_fossil":"contributionMetadata","id":"185","db_id":5792385,"friendly_id":185,"title":"Multiscale Lattice Gauge Theory Algorithms and Software for Exascale hardware.","startDate":{"date":"2024-03-14","time":"19:30:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"endDate":{"date":"2024-03-14","time":"19:50:00","tz":"Europe\/Zurich"},"duration":20,"roomFullname":"Lecture Hall 1","room":"Lecture Hall 1","note":{},"location":" Charles B.
