2024-03-11,07:50:00 PM,Lecture Hall 2,Wire-Cell: A High Quality Automated LArTPC Reconstruction for Neutrino Experiments,"A novel 3D LArTPC reconstruction system called Wire-Cell for deep insight into neutrino experiments is discussed in this presentation. Focus is on innovative algorithms and validation via real data, specifically MicroBooNE physics analyses. This work addresses key challenges surrounding event freedom and software demands in LArTPC setup. By melding traditional and machine learning algorithms, Wire-Cell sets a high-quality standard for automated LArTPC reconstruction in current and next-gen neutrino experiments like DUNE and the SBN program. Moreover, it offers deep domain knowledge, a substantial contribution in streamlining LArTPC technology through the Wire-Cell package. However, despite my expressed disinterest in specific topics related to Quantum Computing and Lattice Gauge Theory, which is far from the talk's theme, I am moderately intrigued by the abstract because it touches upon key interests, such as Deep Domain Learning, Reconstruction Methods, and Data Processing frameworks, specifically Python and DataFrame (noted in the original list). The application of such techniques in developing a robust LArTPC setup for analyzing complex physics data from neutrino interactions seems promising and relevant. Though Lattice Gauge Theory might be mentioned, it doesn't form the core area of this presentation. Thus, while not directly aligning with all specified interests, the potential for practical, wide-ranging applications in experimental particle physics makes this abstract worth attention.",MicroBooNE,"['Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber', 'LArTPC', 'Neutrino Experiments', '3D Reconstruction', 'Automated Reconstruction', 'Machine Learning Algorithms', 'Data Processing Frameworks', 'Deep Learning', 'Neutrino Interactions']",0,Oral

Using a new machine learning model to replace computationally expensive modules in PR-DNS simulations. The new models are evaluated for accuracy and computational speed in numerical simulations designed to assess their suitability for relevant dynamical systems. The abstract is discussing the application of Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) to accelerate and enhance the efficiency and accuracy of particle-resolved direct numerical simulations (PR-DNS) used in atmospheric physics. Although this topic is not strictly within the domain of high-energy physics, it shares similar underlying themes, such as the use of machine learning models and data-driven approaches. As such, my interest in this topic is assessed as 'low' since it is not directly related to the areas I'm very interested in. Nonetheless, the interdisciplinary nature of the subject might potentially yield benefits for research in high-energy physics that are applicable in other fields such as atmospheric physics. Thus, although I don't expect to gain as deep of insight into my field of interest as from a more focused talk, I might still find the research fascinating and potentially gain some knowledge that can be adapted or transferred to the challenges of high energy physics, although the probability is comparatively lower than from a talk more directly related to my field of interest.",,"['Fourier Neural Operators', 'particle-resolved direct numerical simulations', 'atmospheric physics', 'aerosol-cloud interactions', 'machine learning', 'vorticity fields', 'recurrent structure in time']",1,Oral
